      SCENE I.
    </h2>
<pre>



     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Egregious viceroys of these eastern parts,
     Plac'd by the issue of great Bajazeth,
     And sacred lord, the mighty Callapine,
     Who lives in Egypt prisoner to that slave
     Which kept his father in an iron cage,
     Now have we march'd from fair Natolia
     Two hundred leagues, and on Danubius' banks
     Our warlike host, in complete armour, rest,
     Where Sigismund, the king of Hungary,
     Should meet our person to conclude a truce:
     What! shall we parle with the Christian?
     Or cross the stream, and meet him in the field?

     &lt;name&gt;GAZELLUS&lt;name&gt;
     King of Natolia, let us treat of peace:
     We all are glutted with the Christians' blood,
     And have a greater foe to fight against,
     Proud Tamburlaine, that now in Asia,
     Near Guyron's head, doth set his conquering feet,
     And means to fire Turkey as he goes:
     'Gainst him, my lord, you must address your power.

     &lt;name&gt;URIBASSA&lt;name&gt;
     Besides, King Sigismund hath brought from Christendom
     More than his camp of stout Hungarians,
     Sclavonians, Almains, Rutters,  Muffs, and Danes,
     That with the halberd, lance, and murdering axe,
     Will hazard that we might with surety hold.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Though from the shortest northern parallel,
     Vast Grantland, compass'd with the Frozen Sea,
     (Inhabited with tall and sturdy men,
     Giants as big as hugy  Polypheme,)
     Millions of soldiers cut the  arctic line,
     Bringing the strength of Europe to these arms,
     Our Turkey blades shall glide through all their throats,
     And make this champion  mead a bloody fen:
     Danubius' stream, that runs to Trebizon,
     Shall carry, wrapt within his scarlet waves,
     As martial presents to our friends at home,
     The slaughter'd bodies of these Christians:
     The Terrene  main, wherein Danubius falls,
     Shall by this battle be the bloody sea:
     The wandering sailors of proud Italy
     Shall meet those Christians, fleeting with the tide,
     Beating in heaps against their argosies,
     And make fair Europe, mounted on her bull,
     Trapp'd with the wealth and riches of the world,
     Alight, and wear a woful mourning weed.

     &lt;name&gt;GAZELLUS&lt;name&gt;
     Yet, stout Orcanes, pro-rex of the world,
     Since Tamburlaine hath muster'd all his men,
     Marching from Cairo  northward, with his camp,
     To Alexandria and the frontier towns,
     Meaning to make a conquest of our land,
     'Tis requisite to parle for a peace
     With Sigismund, the king of Hungary,
     And save our forces for the hot assaults
     Proud Tamburlaine intends Natolia.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Viceroy of Byron, wisely hast thou said.
     My realm, the centre of our empery,
     Once lost, all Turkey would be overthrown;
     And for that cause the Christians shall have peace.
     Sclavonians, Almains, Rutters, Muffs, and Danes,
     Fear  not Orcanes, but great Tamburlaine;
     Nor he, but Fortune that hath made him great.
     We have revolted Grecians, Albanese,
     Sicilians, Jews, Arabians, Turks, and Moors,
     Natolians, Sorians,  black  Egyptians,
     Illyrians, Thracians, and Bithynians, 
     Enough to swallow forceless Sigismund,
     Yet scarce enough t' encounter Tamburlaine.
     He brings a world of people to the field,
     ]From Scythia to the oriental plage 
     Of India, where raging Lantchidol
     Beats on the regions with his boisterous blows,
     That never seaman yet discovered.
     All Asia is in arms with Tamburlaine,
     Even from the midst of fiery Cancer's tropic
     To Amazonia under Capricorn;
     And thence, as far as Archipelago,
     All Afric is in arms with Tamburlaine:
     Therefore, viceroy,  the Christians must have peace.




     &lt;name&gt;SIGISMUND&lt;name&gt;
     Orcanes, (as our legates promis'd thee,)
     We, with our peers, have cross'd Danubius' stream,
     To treat of friendly peace or deadly war.
     Take which thou wilt; for, as the Romans us'd,
     I here present thee with a naked sword:
     Wilt thou have war, then shake this blade at me;
     If peace, restore it to my hands again,
     And I will sheathe it, to confirm the same.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Stay, Sigismund:  forgett'st thou I am he
     That with the cannon shook Vienna-walls,
     And made it dance upon the continent,
     As when the massy substance of the earth
     Quiver about the axle-tree of heaven?
     Forgett'st thou that I sent a shower of darts,
     Mingled with powder'd shot and feather'd steel,
     So thick upon the blink-ey'd burghers' heads,
     That thou thyself, then County Palatine,
     The King of Boheme,  and the Austric Duke,
     Sent heralds out, which basely on their knees,
     In all your names, desir'd a truce of me?
     Forgett'st thou that, to have me raise my siege,
     Waggons of gold were set before my tent,
     Stampt with the princely fowl that in her wings
     Carries the fearful thunderbolts of Jove?
     How canst thou think of this, and offer war?

     &lt;name&gt;SIGISMUND&lt;name&gt;
     Vienna was besieg'd, and I was there,
     Then County Palatine, but now a king,
     And what we did was in extremity
     But now, Orcanes, view my royal host,
     That hides these plains, and seems as vast and wide
     As doth the desert of Arabia
     To those that stand on Bagdet's  lofty tower,
     Or as the ocean to the traveller
     That rests upon the snowy Appenines;
     And tell me whether I should stoop so low,
     Or treat of peace with the Natolian king.

     &lt;name&gt;GAZELLUS&lt;name&gt;
     Kings of Natolia and of Hungary,
     We came from Turkey to confirm a league,
     And not to dare each other to the field.
     A friendly parle  might become you both.

     &lt;name&gt;FREDERICK&lt;name&gt;
     And we from Europe, to the same intent;
     Which if your general refuse or scorn,
     Our tents are pitch'd, our men stand  in array,
     Ready to charge you ere you stir your feet.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     So prest  are we:  but yet, if Sigismund
     Speak as a friend, and stand not upon terms,
     Here is his sword; let peace be ratified
     On these conditions specified before,
     Drawn with advice of our ambassadors.

     &lt;name&gt;SIGISMUND&lt;name&gt;
     Then here I sheathe it, and give thee my hand,
     Never to draw it out, or  manage arms
     Against thyself or thy confederates,
     But, whilst I live, will be at truce with thee.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     But, Sigismund, confirm it with an oath,
     And swear in sight of heaven and by thy Christ.

     &lt;name&gt;SIGISMUND&lt;name&gt;
     By Him that made the world and sav'd my soul,
     The Son of God and issue of a maid,
     Sweet Jesus Christ, I solemnly protest
     And vow to keep this peace inviolable!

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     By sacred Mahomet, the friend of God,
     Whose holy Alcoran remains with us,
     Whose glorious body, when he left the world,
     Clos'd in a coffin mounted up the air,
     And hung on stately Mecca's temple-roof,
     I swear to keep this truce inviolable!
     Of whose conditions  and our solemn oaths,
     Sign'd with our hands, each shall retain a scroll,
     As memorable witness of our league.
     Now, Sigismund, if any Christian king
     Encroach upon the confines of thy realm,
     Send word, Orcanes of Natolia
     Confirm'd  this league beyond Danubius' stream,
     And they will, trembling, sound a quick retreat;
     So am I fear'd among all nations.

     &lt;name&gt;SIGISMUND&lt;name&gt;
     If any heathen potentate or king
     Invade Natolia, Sigismund will send
     A hundred thousand horse train'd to the war,
     And back'd by  stout lanciers of Germany,
     The strength and sinews of the imperial seat.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     I thank thee, Sigismund; but, when I war,
     All Asia Minor, Africa, and Greece,
     Follow my standard and my thundering drums.
     Come, let us go and banquet in our tents:
     I will despatch chief of my army hence
     To fair Natolia and to Trebizon,
     To stay my coming 'gainst proud Tamburlaine:
     Friend Sigismund, and peers of Hungary,
     Come, banquet and carouse with us a while,
     And then depart we to our territories.</pre>

      SCENE II.
    </h2>
<pre>


     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Sweet Almeda, pity the ruthful plight
     Of Callapine, the son of Bajazeth,
     Born to be monarch of the western world,
     Yet here detain'd by cruel Tamburlaine.

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, I pity it, and with my heart
     Wish your release; but he whose wrath is death,
     My sovereign lord, renowmed  Tamburlaine,
     Forbids you further liberty than this.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Ah, were I now but half so eloquent
     To paint in words what I'll perform in deeds,
     I know thou wouldst depart from hence with me!

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     Not for all Afric:  therefore move me not.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Yet hear me speak, my gentle Almeda.

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     No speech to that end, by your favour, sir.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     By Cairo  runs

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     No talk of running, I tell you, sir.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     A little further, gentle Almeda.

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     Well, sir, what of this?

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     By Cairo runs to Alexandria-bay
     Darotes' stream,  wherein at  anchor lies
     A Turkish galley of my royal fleet,
     Waiting my coming to the river-side,
     Hoping by some means I shall be releas'd;
     Which, when I come aboard, will hoist up sail,
     And soon put forth into the Terrene  sea,
     Where,  'twixt the isles of Cyprus and of Crete,
     We quickly may in Turkish seas arrive.
     Then shalt thou see a hundred kings and more,
     Upon their knees, all bid me welcome home.
     Amongst so many crowns of burnish'd gold,
     Choose which thou wilt, all are at thy command:
     A thousand galleys, mann'd with Christian slaves,
     I freely give thee, which shall cut the Straits,
     And bring armadoes, from  the coasts of Spain,
     Fraughted with gold of rich America:
     The Grecian virgins shall attend on thee,
     Skilful in music and in amorous lays,
     As fair as was Pygmalion's ivory girl
     Or lovely Io metamorphosed:
     With naked negroes shall thy coach be drawn,
     And, as thou rid'st in triumph through the streets,
     The pavement underneath thy chariot-wheels
     With Turkey-carpets shall be covered,
     And cloth of arras hung about the walls,
     Fit objects for thy princely eye to pierce:
     A hundred bassoes, cloth'd in crimson silk,
     Shall ride before thee on Barbarian steeds;
     And, when thou goest, a golden canopy
     Enchas'd with precious stones, which shine as bright
     As that fair veil that covers all the world,
     When Phoebus, leaping from his hemisphere,
     Descendeth downward to th' Antipodes:
     And more than this, for all I cannot tell.

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     How far hence lies the galley, say you?

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Sweet Almeda, scarce half a league from hence.

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     But need  we not be spied going aboard?

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Betwixt the hollow hanging of a hill,
     And crooked bending of a craggy rock,
     The sails wrapt up, the mast and tacklings down,
     She lies so close that none can find her out.

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     I like that well:  but, tell me, my lord,
     if I should let you go, would you be as good as
     your word? shall I be made a king for my labour?

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     As I am Callapine the emperor,
     And by the hand of Mahomet I swear,
     Thou shalt be crown'd a king, and be my mate!

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     Then here I swear, as I am Almeda,
     Your keeper under Tamburlaine the Great,
     (For that's the style and title I have yet,)
     Although he sent a thousand armed men
     To intercept this haughty enterprize,
     Yet would I venture to conduct your grace,
     And die before I brought you back again!

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Thanks, gentle Almeda:  then let us haste,
     Lest time be past, and lingering let  us both.

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     When you will, my lord:  I am ready.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Even straight:—and farewell, cursed Tamburlaine!
     Now go I to revenge my father's death.</pre>

<h2>
      SCENE III.
    </h2>
<pre>



     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Now, bright Zenocrate, the world's fair eye,
     Whose beams illuminate the lamps of heaven,
     Whose cheerful looks do clear the cloudy air,
     And clothe it in a crystal livery,
     Now rest thee here on fair Larissa-plains,
     Where Egypt and the Turkish empire part
     Between thy sons, that shall be emperors,
     And every one commander of a world.

     &lt;name&gt;ZENOCRATE&lt;name&gt;
     Sweet Tamburlaine, when wilt thou leave these arms,
     And save thy sacred person free from scathe,
     And dangerous chances of the wrathful war?

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     When heaven shall cease to move on both the poles,
     And when the ground, whereon my soldiers march,
     Shall rise aloft and touch the horned moon;
     And not before, my sweet Zenocrate.
     Sit up, and rest thee like a lovely queen.
     So; now she sits in pomp and majesty,
     When these, my sons, more precious in mine eyes
     Than all the wealthy kingdoms I subdu'd,
     Plac'd by her side, look on their mother's face.
     But yet methinks their looks are amorous,
     Not martial as the sons of Tamburlaine:
     Water and air, being symboliz'd in one,
     Argue their want of courage and of wit;
     Their hair as white as milk, and soft as down,
     (Which should be like the quills of porcupines,
     As black as jet, and hard as iron or steel,)
     Bewrays they are too dainty for the wars;
     Their fingers made to quaver on a lute,
     Their arms to hang about a lady's neck,
     Their legs to dance and caper in the air,
     Would make me think them bastards, not my sons,
     But that I know they issu'd from thy womb,
     That never look'd on man but Tamburlaine.

     &lt;name&gt;ZENOCRATE&lt;name&gt;
     My gracious lord, they have their mother's looks,
     But, when they list, their conquering father's heart.
     This lovely boy, the youngest of the three,
     Not long ago bestrid a Scythian steed,
     Trotting the ring, and tilting at a glove,
     Which when he tainted  with his slender rod,
     He rein'd him straight, and made him so curvet
     As I cried out for fear he should have faln.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     
     Well done, my boy! thou shalt have shield and lance,
     Armour of proof, horse, helm, and curtle-axe,
     And I will teach thee how to charge thy foe,
     And harmless run among the deadly pikes.
     If thou wilt love the wars and follow me,
     Thou shalt be made a king and reign with me,
     Keeping in iron cages emperors.
     If thou exceed thy elder brothers' worth,
     And shine in complete virtue more than they,
     Thou shalt be king before them, and thy seed
     Shall issue crowned from their mother's womb.

     &lt;name&gt;CELEBINUS&lt;name&gt;
     Yes, father; you shall see me, if I live,
     Have under me as many kings as you,
     And march with such a multitude of men
     As all the world shall  tremble at their view.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     These words assure me, boy, thou art my son.
     When I am old and cannot manage arms,
     Be thou the scourge and terror of the world.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     Why may not I, my lord, as well as he,
     Be term'd the scourge and terror of  the world?

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Be all a scourge and terror to  the world,
     Or else you are not sons of Tamburlaine.

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     But, while my brothers follow arms, my lord,
     Let me accompany my gracious mother:
     They are enough to conquer all the world,
     And you have won enough for me to keep.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Bastardly boy, sprung  from some coward's loins,
     And not the issue of great Tamburlaine!
     Of all the provinces I have subdu'd
     Thou shalt not have a foot, unless thou bear
     A mind courageous and invincible;
     For he shall wear the crown of Persia
     Whose head hath deepest scars, whose breast most wounds,
     Which, being wroth, sends lightning from his eyes,
     And in the furrows of his frowning brows
     Harbours revenge, war, death, and cruelty;
     For in a field, whose superficies 
     Is cover'd with a liquid purple veil,
     And sprinkled with the brains of slaughter'd men,
     My royal chair of state shall be advanc'd;
     And he that means to place himself therein,
     Must armed wade up to the chin in blood.

     &lt;name&gt;ZENOCRATE&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, such speeches to our princely sons
     Dismay their minds before they come to prove
     The wounding troubles angry war affords.

     &lt;name&gt;CELEBINUS&lt;name&gt;
     No, madam, these are speeches fit for us;
     For, if his chair were in a sea of blood,
     I would prepare a ship and sail to it,
     Ere I would lose the title of a king.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     And I would strive to swim through  pools of blood,
     Or make a bridge of murder'd carcasses, 
     Whose arches should be fram'd with bones of Turks,
     Ere I would lose the title of a king.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Well, lovely boys, ye shall be emperors both,
     Stretching your conquering arms from east to west:
     And, sirrah, if you mean to wear a crown,
     When we  shall meet the Turkish deputy
     And all his viceroys, snatch it from his head,
     And cleave his pericranion with thy sword.

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     If any man will hold him, I will strike,
     And cleave him to the channel  with my sword.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Hold him, and cleave him too, or I'll cleave thee;
     For we will march against them presently.
     Theridamas, Techelles, and Casane
     Promis'd to meet me on Larissa-plains,
     With hosts a-piece against this Turkish crew;
     For I have sworn by sacred Mahomet
     To make it parcel of my empery.
     The trumpets sound; Zenocrate, they come.

     Welcome, Theridamas, king of Argier.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, the great and mighty Tamburlaine,
     Arch-monarch of the world, I offer here
     My crown, myself, and all the power I have,
     In all affection at thy kingly feet.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Thanks, good Theridamas.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Under my colours march ten thousand Greeks,
     And of Argier and Afric's frontier towns
     Twice twenty thousand valiant men-at-arms;
     All which have sworn to sack Natolia.
     Five hundred brigandines are under sail,
     Meet for your service on the sea, my lord,
     That, launching from Argier to Tripoly,
     Will quickly ride before Natolia,
     And batter down the castles on the shore.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Well said, Argier! receive thy crown again.

     Kings of Morocco  and of Fez, welcome.

     &lt;name&gt;USUMCASANE&lt;name&gt;
     Magnificent and peerless Tamburlaine,
     I and my neighbour king of Fez have brought,
     To aid thee in this Turkish expedition,
     A hundred thousand expert soldiers;
     ]From Azamor to Tunis near the sea
     Is Barbary unpeopled for thy sake,
     And all the men in armour under me,
     Which with my crown I gladly offer thee.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Thanks, king of Morocco:  take your crown again.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     And, mighty Tamburlaine, our earthly god,
     Whose looks make this inferior world to quake,
     I here present thee with the crown of Fez,
     And with an host of Moors train'd to the war, 
     Whose coal-black faces make their foes retire,
     And quake for fear, as if infernal  Jove,
     Meaning to aid thee  in these  Turkish arms,
     Should pierce the black circumference of hell,
     With ugly Furies bearing fiery flags,
     And millions of his strong  tormenting spirits:
     ]From strong Tesella unto Biledull
     All Barbary is unpeopled for thy sake.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Thanks, king of Fez:  take here thy crown again.
     Your presence, loving friends and fellow-kings,
     Makes me to surfeit in conceiving joy:
     If all the crystal gates of Jove's high court
     Were open'd wide, and I might enter in
     To see the state and majesty of heaven,
     It could not more delight me than your sight.
     Now will we banquet on these plains a while,
     And after march to Turkey with our camp,
     In number more than are the drops that fall
     When Boreas rents a thousand swelling clouds;
     And proud Orcanes of Natolia
     With all his viceroys shall be so afraid,
     That, though the stones, as at Deucalion's flood,
     Were turn'd to men, he should be overcome.
     Such lavish will I make of Turkish blood,
     That Jove shall send his winged messenger
     To bid me sheathe my sword and leave the field;
     The sun, unable to sustain the sight,
     Shall hide his head in Thetis' watery lap,
     And leave his steeds to fair Bootes'  charge;
     For half the world shall perish in this fight.
     But now, my friends, let me examine ye;
     How have ye spent your absent time from me?

     &lt;name&gt;USUMCASANE&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, our men of Barbary have march'd
     Four hundred miles with armour on their backs,
     And lain in leaguer  fifteen months and more;
     For, since we left you at the Soldan's court,
     We have subdu'd the southern Guallatia,
     And all the land unto the coast of Spain;
     We kept the narrow Strait of Jubalter, 
     And made Canaria call us kings and lords:
     Yet never did they recreate themselves,
     Or cease one day from war and hot alarms;
     And therefore let them rest a while, my lord.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     They shall, Casane, and 'tis time, i'faith.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     And I have march'd along the river Nile
     To Machda, where the mighty Christian priest,
     Call'd John the Great,  sits in a milk-white robe,
     Whose triple mitre I did take by force,
     And made him swear obedience to my crown.
     ]From thence unto Cazates did I march,
     Where Amazonians met me in the field,
     With whom, being women, I vouchsaf'd a league,
     And with my power did march to Zanzibar,
     The western part of Afric, where I view'd
     The Ethiopian sea, rivers and lakes,
     But neither man nor child in all the land:
     Therefore I took my course to Manico,
     Where,  unresisted, I remov'd my camp;
     And, by the coast of Byather,  at last
     I came to Cubar, where the negroes dwell,
     And, conquering that, made haste to Nubia.
     There, having sack'd Borno, the kingly seat,
     I took the king and led him bound in chains
     Unto Damascus,  where I stay'd before.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Well done, Techelles!—What saith Theridamas?

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     I left the confines and the bounds of Afric,
     And made  a voyage into Europe,
     Where, by the river Tyras, I subdu'd
     Stoka, Podolia, and Codemia;
     Then cross'd the sea and came to Oblia,
     And Nigra Silva, where the devils dance,
     Which, in despite of them, I set on fire.
     ]From thence I cross'd the gulf call'd by the name
     Mare Majore of the inhabitants.
     Yet shall my soldiers make no period
     Until Natolia kneel before your feet.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Then will we triumph, banquet and carouse;
     Cooks shall have pensions to provide us cates,
     And glut us with the dainties of the world;
     Lachryma Christi and Calabrian wines
     Shall common soldiers drink in quaffing bowls,
     Ay, liquid gold, when we have conquer'd him, 
     Mingled with coral and with orient  pearl.
     Come, let us banquet and carouse the whiles.</pre>

      SCENE I.
    </h2>
<pre>


     &lt;name&gt;SIGISMUND&lt;name&gt;
     Now say, my lords of Buda and Bohemia,
     What motion is it that inflames your thoughts,
     And stirs your valours to such sudden arms?

     &lt;name&gt;FREDERICK&lt;name&gt;
     Your majesty remembers, I am sure,
     What cruel slaughter of our Christian bloods
     These heathenish Turks and pagans lately made
     Betwixt the city Zula and Danubius;
     How through the midst of Varna and Bulgaria,
     And almost to the very walls of Rome,
     They have, not long since, massacred our camp.
     It resteth now, then, that your majesty
     Take all advantages of time and power,
     And work revenge upon these infidels.
     Your highness knows, for Tamburlaine's repair,
     That strikes a terror to all Turkish hearts,
     Natolia hath dismiss'd the greatest part
     Of all his army, pitch'd against our power
     Betwixt Cutheia and Orminius' mount,
     And sent them marching up to Belgasar,
     Acantha, Antioch, and Caesarea,
     To aid the kings of Soria  and Jerusalem.
     Now, then, my lord, advantage take thereof, 
     And issue suddenly upon the rest;
     That, in the fortune of their overthrow,
     We may discourage all the pagan troop
     That dare attempt to war with Christians.

     &lt;name&gt;SIGISMUND&lt;name&gt;
     But calls not, then, your grace to memory
     The league we lately made with King Orcanes,
     Confirm'd by oath and articles of peace,
     And calling Christ for record of our truths?
     This should be treachery and violence
     Against the grace of our profession.

     &lt;name&gt;BALDWIN&lt;name&gt;
     No whit, my lord; for with such infidels,
     In whom no faith nor true religion rests,
     We are not bound to those accomplishments
     The holy laws of Christendom enjoin;
     But, as the faith which they profanely plight
     Is not by necessary policy
     To be esteem'd assurance for ourselves,
     So that we vow  to them should not infringe
     Our liberty of arms and victory.

     &lt;name&gt;SIGISMUND&lt;name&gt;
     Though I confess the oaths they undertake
     Breed little strength to our security,
     Yet those infirmities that thus defame
     Their faiths,  their honours, and religion, 
     Should not give us presumption to the like.
     Our faiths are sound, and must be consummate, 
     Religious, righteous, and inviolate.

     &lt;name&gt;FREDERICK&lt;name&gt;
     Assure your grace, 'tis superstition
     To stand so strictly on dispensive faith;
     And, should we lose the opportunity
     That God hath given to venge our Christians' death,
     And scourge their foul blasphemous paganism,
     As fell to Saul, to Balaam, and the rest,
     That would not kill and curse at God's command,
     So surely will the vengeance of the Highest,
     And jealous anger of his fearful arm,
     Be pour'd with rigour on our sinful heads,
     If we neglect this  offer'd victory.

     &lt;name&gt;SIGISMUND&lt;name&gt;
     Then arm, my lords, and issue suddenly,
     Giving commandment to our general host,
     With expedition to assail the pagan,
     And take the victory our God hath given.</pre>

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Gazellus, Uribassa, and the rest,
     Now will we march from proud Orminius' mount
     To fair Natolia, where our neighbour kings
     Expect our power and our royal presence,
     T' encounter with the cruel Tamburlaine,
     That nigh Larissa sways a mighty host,
     And with the thunder of his martial  tools
     Makes earthquakes in the hearts of men and heaven.

     &lt;name&gt;GAZELLUS&lt;name&gt;
     And now come we to make his sinews shake
     With greater power than erst his pride hath felt.
     An hundred kings, by scores, will bid him arms,
     And hundred thousands subjects to each score:
     Which, if a shower of wounding thunderbolts
     Should break out of the bowels of the clouds,
     And fall as thick as hail upon our heads,
     In partial aid of that proud Scythian,
     Yet should our courages and steeled crests,
     And numbers, more than infinite, of men,
     Be able to withstand and conquer him.

     &lt;name&gt;URIBASSA&lt;name&gt;
     Methinks I see how glad the Christian king
     Is made for joy of our  admitted truce,
     That could not but before be terrified
     With  unacquainted power of our host.



     &lt;name&gt;MESSENGER&lt;name&gt;
     Arm, dread sovereign, and my noble lords!
     The treacherous army of the Christians,
     Taking advantage of your slender power,
     Comes marching on us, and determines straight
     To bid us battle for our dearest lives.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Traitors, villains, damned Christians!
     Have I not here the articles of peace
     And solemn covenants we have both confirm'd,
     He by his Christ, and I by Mahomet?

     &lt;name&gt;GAZELLUS&lt;name&gt;
     Hell and confusion light upon their heads,
     That with such treason seek our overthrow,
     And care so little for their prophet Christ!

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Can there be such deceit in Christians,
     Or treason in the fleshly heart of man,
     Whose shape is figure of the highest God?
     Then, if there be a Christ, as Christians say,
     But in their deeds deny him for their Christ,
     If he be son to everliving Jove,
     And hath the power of his outstretched arm,
     If he be jealous of his name and honour
     As is our holy prophet Mahomet,
     Take here these papers as our sacrifice
     And witness of thy servant's  perjury!

     Open, thou shining veil of Cynthia,
     And make a passage from th' empyreal heaven,
     That he that sits on high and never sleeps,
     Nor in one place is circumscriptible,
     But every where fills every continent
     With strange infusion of his sacred vigour,
     May, in his endless power and purity,
     Behold and venge this traitor's perjury!
     Thou, Christ, that art esteem'd omnipotent,
     If thou wilt prove thyself a perfect God,
     Worthy the worship of all faithful hearts,
     Be now reveng'd upon this traitor's soul,
     And make the power I have left behind
     (Too little to defend our guiltless lives)
     Sufficient to discomfit  and confound
     The trustless force of those false Christians!
     To arms, my lords!  on Christ still let us cry:
     If there be Christ, we shall have victory.</pre>

     &lt;name&gt;SIGISMUND&lt;name&gt;
     Discomfited is all the Christian  host,
     And God hath thunder'd vengeance from on high,
     For my accurs'd and hateful perjury.
     O just and dreadful punisher of sin,
     Let the dishonour of the pains I feel
     In this my mortal well-deserved wound
     End all my penance in my sudden death!
     And let this death, wherein to sin I die,
     Conceive a second life in endless mercy!




     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Now lie the Christians bathing in their bloods,
     And Christ or Mahomet hath been my friend.

     &lt;name&gt;GAZELLUS&lt;name&gt;
     See, here the perjur'd traitor Hungary,
     Bloody and breathless for his villany!

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Now shall his barbarous body be a prey
     To beasts and fowls, and all the winds shall breathe,
     Through shady leaves of every senseless tree,
     Murmurs and hisses for his heinous sin.
     Now scalds his soul in the Tartarian streams,
     And feeds upon the baneful tree of hell,
     That Zoacum,  that fruit of bitterness,
     That in the midst of fire is ingraff'd,
     Yet flourisheth, as Flora in her pride,
     With apples like the heads of damned fiends.
     The devils there, in chains of quenchless flame,
     Shall lead his soul, through Orcus' burning gulf,
     ]From pain to pain, whose change shall never end.
     What say'st thou yet, Gazellus, to his foil,
     Which we referr'd to justice of his Christ
     And to his power, which here appears as full
     As rays of Cynthia to the clearest sight?

     &lt;name&gt;GAZELLUS&lt;name&gt;
     'Tis but the fortune of the wars, my lord,
     Whose power is often prov'd a miracle.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Yet in my thoughts shall Christ be honoured,
     Not doing Mahomet an  injury,
     Whose power had share in this our victory;
     And, since this miscreant hath disgrac'd his faith,
     And died a traitor both to heaven and earth,
     We will both watch and ward shall keep his trunk 
     Amidst these plains for fowls to prey upon.
     Go, Uribassa, give  it straight in charge.

     &lt;name&gt;URIBASSA&lt;name&gt;
     I will, my lord.


     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     And now, Gazellus, let us haste and meet
     Our army, and our brother of Jerusalem,
     Of Soria,  Trebizon, and Amasia,
     And happily, with full Natolian bowls
     Of Greekish wine, now let us celebrate
     Our happy conquest and his angry fate.</pre>

      SCENE IV.
    </h2>
<pre>






     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Black is the beauty of the brightest day;
     The golden ball of heaven's eternal fire,
     That danc'd with glory on the silver waves,
     Now wants the fuel that inflam'd his beams;
     And all with faintness, and for foul disgrace,
     He binds his temples with a frowning cloud,
     Ready to darken earth with endless night.
     Zenocrate, that gave him light and life,
     Whose eyes shot fire from their  ivory brows, 
     And temper'd every soul with lively heat,
     Now by the malice of the angry skies,
     Whose jealousy admits no second mate,
     Draws in the comfort of her latest breath,
     All dazzled with the hellish mists of death.
     Now walk the angels on the walls of heaven,
     As sentinels to warn th' immortal souls
     To entertain divine Zenocrate:
     Apollo, Cynthia, and the ceaseless lamps
     That gently look'd upon this  loathsome earth,
     Shine downwards now no more, but deck the heavens
     To entertain divine Zenocrate:
     The crystal springs, whose taste illuminates
     Refined eyes with an eternal sight,
     Like tried silver run through Paradise
     To entertain divine Zenocrate:
     The cherubins and holy seraphins,
     That sing and play before the King of Kings,
     Use all their voices and their instruments
     To entertain divine Zenocrate;
     And, in this sweet and curious harmony,
     The god that tunes this music to our souls
     Holds out his hand in highest majesty
     To entertain divine Zenocrate.
     Then let some holy trance convey my thoughts
     Up to the palace of th' empyreal heaven,
     That this my life may be as short to me
     As are the days of sweet Zenocrate.
     Physicians, will no  physic do her good?

     &lt;name&gt;FIRST PHYSICIAN&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, your majesty shall soon perceive,
     An if she pass this fit, the worst is past.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Tell me, how fares my fair Zenocrate?

     &lt;name&gt;ZENOCRATE&lt;name&gt;
     I fare, my lord, as other empresses,
     That, when this frail and  transitory flesh
     Hath suck'd the measure of that vital air
     That feeds the body with his dated health,
     Wane with enforc'd and necessary change.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     May never such a change transform my love,
     In whose sweet being I repose my life!
     Whose heavenly presence, beautified with health,
     Gives light to Phoebus and the fixed stars;
     Whose absence makes  the sun and moon as dark
     As when, oppos'd in one diameter,
     Their spheres are mounted on the serpent's head,
     Or else descended to his winding train.
     Live still, my love, and so conserve my life,
     Or, dying, be the author  of my death.

     &lt;name&gt;ZENOCRATE&lt;name&gt;
     Live still, my lord; O, let my sovereign live!
     And sooner let the fiery element
     Dissolve, and make your kingdom in the sky,
     Than this base earth should shroud your majesty;
     For, should I but suspect your death by mine,
     The comfort of my future happiness,
     And hope to meet your highness in the heavens,
     Turn'd to despair, would break my wretched breast,
     And fury would confound my present rest.
     But let me die, my love; yes,  let me die;
     With love and patience let your true love die:
     Your grief and fury hurts my second life.
     Yet let me kiss my lord before I die,
     And let me die with kissing of my lord.
     But, since my life is lengthen'd yet a while,
     Let me take leave of these my loving sons,
     And of my lords, whose true nobility
     Have merited my latest memory.
     Sweet sons, farewell! in death resemble me,
     And in your lives your father's excellence. 
     Some music, and my fit will cease, my lord.


     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Proud fury, and intolerable fit,
     That dares torment the body of my love,
     And scourge the scourge of the immortal God!
     Now are those spheres, where Cupid us'd to sit,
     Wounding the world with wonder and with love,
     Sadly supplied with pale and ghastly death,
     Whose darts do pierce the centre of my soul.
     Her sacred beauty hath enchanted heaven;
     And, had she liv'd before the siege of Troy,
     Helen, whose beauty summon'd Greece to arms,
     And drew a thousand ships to Tenedos,
     Had not been nam'd in Homer's Iliads,
     Her name had been in every line he wrote;
     Or, had those wanton poets, for whose birth
     Old Rome was proud, but gaz'd a while on her,
     Nor Lesbia nor Corinna had been nam'd,
     Zenocrate had been the argument
     Of every epigram or elegy.

     What, is she dead?  Techelles, draw thy sword,
     And wound the earth, that it may cleave in twain,
     And we descend into th' infernal vaults,
     To hale the Fatal Sisters by the hair,
     And throw them in the triple moat of hell,
     For taking hence my fair Zenocrate.
     Casane and Theridamas, to arms!
     Raise cavalieros  higher than the clouds,
     And with the cannon break the frame of heaven;
     Batter the shining palace of the sun,
     And shiver all the starry firmament,
     For amorous Jove hath snatch'd my love from hence,
     Meaning to make her stately queen of heaven.
     What god soever holds thee in his arms,
     Giving thee nectar and ambrosia,
     Behold me here, divine Zenocrate,
     Raving, impatient, desperate, and mad,
     Breaking my steeled lance, with which I burst
     The rusty beams of Janus' temple-doors,
     Letting out Death and tyrannizing War,
     To march with me under this bloody flag!
     And, if thou pitiest Tamburlaine the Great,
     Come down from heaven, and live with me again!

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Ah, good my lord, be patient! she is dead,
     And all this raging cannot make her live.
     If words might serve, our voice hath rent the air;
     If tears, our eyes have water'd all the earth;
     If grief, our murder'd hearts have strain'd forth blood:
     Nothing prevails,  for she is dead, my lord.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     FOR SHE IS DEAD! thy words do pierce my soul:
     Ah, sweet Theridamas, say so no more!
     Though she be dead, yet let me think she lives,
     And feed my mind that dies for want of her.
     Where'er her soul be, thou  shalt stay with me,
     Embalm'd with cassia, ambergris, and myrrh,
     Not lapt in lead, but in a sheet of gold,
     And, till I die, thou shalt not be interr'd.
     Then in as rich a tomb as Mausolus' 
     We both will rest, and have one  epitaph
     Writ in as many several languages
     As I have conquer'd kingdoms with my sword.
     This cursed town will I consume with fire,
     Because this place bereft me of my love;
     The houses, burnt, will look as if they mourn'd;
     And here will I set up her stature, 
     And march about it with my mourning camp,
     Drooping and pining for Zenocrate.</pre>

     Bearing the vengeance of our father's wrongs,
     As all the world should blot his  dignities
     Out of the book of base-born infamies.
     And now I doubt not but your royal cares
     Have so provided for this cursed foe,
     That, since the heir of mighty Bajazeth
     (An emperor so honour'd for his virtues)
     Revives the spirits of all  true Turkish hearts,
     In grievous memory of his father's shame,
     We shall not need to nourish any doubt,
     But that proud Fortune, who hath follow'd long
     The martial sword of mighty Tamburlaine,
     Will now retain her old inconstancy,
     And raise our honours  to as high a pitch,
     In this our strong and fortunate encounter;
     For so hath heaven provided my escape
     ]From all the cruelty my soul sustain'd,
     By this my friendly keeper's happy means,
     That Jove, surcharg'd with pity of our wrongs,
     Will pour it down in showers on our heads,
     Scourging the pride of cursed Tamburlaine.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     I have a hundred thousand men in arms;
     Some that, in conquest  of the perjur'd Christian,
     Being a handful to a mighty host,
     Think them in number yet sufficient
     To drink the river Nile or Euphrates,
     And for their power enow to win the world.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF JERUSALEM&lt;name&gt;
     And I as many from Jerusalem,
     Judaea,  Gaza, and Sclavonia's  bounds,
     That on mount Sinai, with their ensigns spread,
     Look like the parti-colour'd clouds of heaven
     That shew fair weather to the neighbour morn.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF TREBIZON&lt;name&gt;
     And I as many bring from Trebizon,
     Chio, Famastro, and Amasia,
     All bordering on the Mare-Major-sea,
     Riso, Sancina, and the bordering towns
     That touch the end of famous Euphrates,
     Whose courages are kindled with the flames
     The cursed Scythian sets on all their towns,
     And vow to burn the villain's cruel heart.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF SORIA&lt;name&gt;
     From Soria  with seventy thousand strong,
     Ta'en from Aleppo, Soldino, Tripoly,
     And so unto my city of Damascus, 
     I march to meet and aid my neighbour kings;
     All which will join against this Tamburlaine,
     And bring him captive to your highness' feet.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Our battle, then, in martial manner pitch'd,
     According to our ancient use, shall bear
     The figure of the semicircled moon,
     Whose horns shell sprinkle through the tainted air
     The poison'd brains of this proud Scythian.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Well, then, my noble lords, for this my friend
     That freed me from the bondage of my foe,
     I think it requisite and honourable
     To keep my promise and to make him king,
     That is a gentleman, I know, at least.

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     That's no matter,  sir, for being a king;
     or Tamburlaine came up of nothing.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF JERUSALEM&lt;name&gt;
     Your majesty may choose some 'pointed time,
     Performing all your promise to the full;
     'Tis naught for your majesty to give a kingdom.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Then will I shortly keep my promise, Almeda.

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     Why, I thank your majesty.</pre>

      SCENE II.
    </h2>
<pre>





     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     So burn the turrets of this cursed town,
     Flame to the highest region of the air,
     And kindle heaps of exhalations,
     That, being fiery meteors, may presage
     Death and destruction to the inhabitants!
     Over my zenith hang a blazing star,
     That may endure till heaven be dissolv'd,
     Fed with the fresh supply of earthly dregs,
     Threatening a dearth  and famine to this land!
     Flying dragons, lightning, fearful thunder-claps,
     Singe these fair plains, and make them seem as black
     As is the island where the Furies mask,
     Compass'd with Lethe, Styx, and Phlegethon,
     Because my dear Zenocrate is dead!

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     This pillar, plac'd in memory of her,
     Where in Arabian, Hebrew, Greek, is writ,
     THIS TOWN, BEING BURNT BY TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT,
     &lt;name&gt;FORBIDS THE WORLD TO BUILD IT UP AGAIN&lt;name&gt;
     

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     And here this mournful streamer shall be plac'd,
     Wrought with the Persian and th'  Egyptian arms,
     To signify she was a princess born,
     And wife unto the monarch of the East.

     &lt;name&gt;CELEBINUS&lt;name&gt;
     And here this table as a register
     Of all her virtues and perfections.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     And here the picture of Zenocrate,
     To shew her beauty which the world admir'd;
     Sweet picture of divine Zenocrate,
     That, hanging here, will draw the gods from heaven,
     And cause the stars fix'd in the southern arc,
     (Whose lovely faces never any view'd
     That have not pass'd the centre's latitude,)
     As pilgrims travel to our hemisphere,
     Only to gaze upon Zenocrate.
     Thou shalt not beautify Larissa-plains,
     But keep within the circle of mine arms:
     At every town and castle I besiege,
     Thou shalt be set upon my royal tent;
     And, when I meet an army in the field,
     Those  looks will shed such influence in my camp,
     As if Bellona, goddess of the war,
     Threw naked swords and sulphur-balls of fire
     Upon the heads of all our enemies.
     And now, my lords, advance your spears again;
     Sorrow no more, my sweet Casane, now:
     Boys, leave to mourn; this town shall ever mourn,
     Being burnt to cinders for your mother's death.

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     If I had wept a sea of tears for her,
     would not ease the sorrows  I sustain.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     As is that town, so is my heart consum'd
     With grief and sorrow for my mother's death.

     &lt;name&gt;CELEBINUS&lt;name&gt;
     My mother's death hath mortified my mind,
     And sorrow stops the passage of my speech.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     But now, my boys, leave off, and list to me,
     That mean to teach you rudiments of war.
     I'll have you learn to sleep upon the ground,
     March in your armour thorough watery fens,
     Sustain the scorching heat and freezing cold,
     Hunger and thirst,  right adjuncts of the war;
     And, after this, to scale a castle-wall,
     Besiege a fort, to undermine a town,
     And make whole cities caper in the air:
     Then next, the way to fortify your men;
     In champion  grounds what figure serves you best,
     For which  the quinque-angle form is meet,
     Because the corners there may fall more flat
     Whereas  the fort may fittest be assail'd,
     And sharpest where th' assault is desperate:
     The ditches must be deep; the  counterscarps
     Narrow and steep; the walls made high and broad;
     The bulwarks and the rampires large and strong,
     With cavalieros  and thick counterforts,
     And room within to lodge six thousand men;
     It must have privy ditches, countermines,
     And secret issuings to defend the ditch;
     It must have high argins  and cover'd ways
     To keep the bulwark-fronts from battery,
     And parapets to hide the musketeers,
     Casemates to place the great  artillery,
     And store of ordnance, that from every flank
     May scour the outward curtains of the fort,
     Dismount the cannon of the adverse part,
     Murder the foe, and save the  walls from breach.
     When this is learn'd for service on the land,
     By plain and easy demonstration
     I'll teach you how to make the water mount,
     That you may dry-foot march through lakes and pools,
     Deep rivers, havens, creeks, and little seas,
     And make a fortress in the raging waves,
     Fenc'd with the concave of a monstrous rock,
     Invincible by nature  of the place.
     When this is done, then are ye soldiers,
     And worthy sons of Tamburlaine the Great.

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, but this is dangerous to be done;
     We may be slain or wounded ere we learn.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Villain, art thou the son of Tamburlaine,
     And fear'st to die, or with a  curtle-axe
     To hew thy flesh, and make a gaping wound?
     Hast thou beheld a peal of ordnance strike
     A ring of pikes, mingled with shot and horse, 
     Whose shatter'd limbs, being toss'd as high as heaven,
     Hang in the air as thick as sunny motes,
     And canst thou, coward, stand in fear of death?
     Hast thou not seen my horsemen charge the foe,
     Shot through the arms, cut overthwart the hands,
     Dying their lances with their streaming blood,
     And yet at night carouse within my tent,
     Filling their empty veins with airy wine,
     That, being concocted, turns to crimson blood,
     And wilt thou shun the field for fear of wounds?
     View me, thy father, that hath conquer'd kings,
     And, with his  host, march'd  round about the earth,
     Quite void of scars and clear from any wound,
     That by the wars lost not a drop  of blood,
     And see him lance  his flesh to teach you all.

     A wound is nothing, be it ne'er so deep;
     Blood is the god of war's rich livery.
     Now look I like a soldier, and this wound
     As great a grace and majesty to me,
     As if a chair of gold enamelled,
     Enchas'd with diamonds, sapphires, rubies,
     And fairest pearl of wealthy India,
     Were mounted here under a canopy,
     And I sat down, cloth'd with a massy robe
     That late adorn'd the Afric potentate,
     Whom I brought bound unto Damascus' walls.
     Come, boys, and with your fingers search my wound,
     And in my blood wash all your hands at once,
     While I sit smiling to behold the sight.
     Now, my boys, what think ye of a wound?

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     I know not  what I should think of it;
     methinks 'tis a pitiful sight.

     &lt;name&gt;CELEBINUS&lt;name&gt;
     'Tis  nothing.—Give me a wound, father.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     And me another, my lord.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Come, sirrah, give me your arm.

     &lt;name&gt;CELEBINUS&lt;name&gt;
     Here, father, cut it bravely, as you did your own.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     It shall suffice thou dar'st abide a wound;
     My boy, thou shalt not lose a drop of blood
     Before we meet the army of the Turk;
     But then run desperate through the thickest throngs,
     Dreadless of blows, of bloody wounds, and death;
     And let the burning of Larissa-walls,
     My speech of war, and this my wound you see,
     Teach you, my boys, to bear courageous minds,
     Fit for the followers of great Tamburlaine.
     Usumcasane, now come, let us march
     Towards Techelles and Theridamas,
     That we have sent before to fire the towns,
     The towers and cities of these hateful Turks,
     And hunt that coward faint-heart runaway,
     With that accursed  traitor Almeda,
     Till fire and sword have found them at a bay.

     &lt;name&gt;USUMCASANE&lt;name&gt;
     I long to pierce his  bowels with my sword,
     That hath betray'd my gracious sovereign,
     That curs'd and damned traitor Almeda.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Then let us see if coward Callapine
     Dare levy arms against our puissance,
     That we may tread upon his captive neck,
     And treble all his father's slaveries.</pre>

      SCENE III.
    </h2>
<pre>


     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Thus have we march'd northward from Tamburlaine,
     Unto the frontier point  of Soria; 
     And this is Balsera, their chiefest hold,
     Wherein is all the treasure of the land.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     Then let us bring our light artillery,
     Minions, falc'nets, and sakers,  to the trench,
     Filling the ditches with the walls' wide breach,
     And enter in to seize upon the hold.— 
     How say you, soldiers, shall we not?

     &lt;name&gt;SOLDIERS&lt;name&gt;
     Yes, my lord, yes; come, let's about it.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     But stay a while; summon a parle, drum.
     It may be they will yield it quietly, 
     Knowing two kings, the friends  to Tamburlaine,
     Stand at the walls with such a mighty power.



     &lt;name&gt;CAPTAIN&lt;name&gt;
     What require you, my masters?

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Captain, that thou yield up thy hold to us.

     &lt;name&gt;CAPTAIN&lt;name&gt;
     To you! why, do you  think me weary of it?

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     Nay, captain, thou art weary of thy life,
     If thou withstand the friends of Tamburlaine.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     These pioners  of Argier in Africa,
     Even in  the cannon's face, shall raise a hill
     Of earth and faggots higher than thy fort,
     And, over thy argins  and cover'd ways,
     Shall play upon the bulwarks of thy hold
     Volleys of ordnance, till the breach be made
     That with his ruin fills up all the trench;
     And, when we enter in, not heaven itself
     Shall ransom thee, thy wife, and family.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     Captain, these Moors shall cut the leaden pipes
     That bring fresh water to thy men and thee,
     And lie in trench before thy castle-walls,
     That no supply of victual shall come in,
     Nor  issue forth but they shall die;
     And, therefore, captain, yield it quietly. 

     &lt;name&gt;CAPTAIN&lt;name&gt;
     Were you, that are the friends of Tamburlaine,
     Brothers of  holy Mahomet himself,
     I would not yield it; therefore do your worst:
     Raise mounts, batter, intrench, and undermine,
     Cut off the water, all convoys that can, 
     Yet I am  resolute:  and so, farewell.


     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Pioners, away! and where I stuck the stake,
     Intrench with those dimensions I prescrib'd;
     Cast up the earth towards the castle-wall,
     Which, till it may defend you, labour low,
     And few or none shall perish by their shot.

     &lt;name&gt;PIONERS&lt;name&gt;
     We will, my lord.


     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     A hundred horse shall scout about the plains,
     To spy what force comes to relieve the hold.
     Both we, Theridamas, will intrench our men,
     And with the Jacob's staff measure the height
     And distance of the castle from the trench,
     That we may know if our artillery
     Will carry full point-blank unto their walls.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Then see the bringing of our ordnance
     Along the trench into  the battery,
     Where we will have gallions of six foot broad,
     To save our cannoneers from musket-shot;
     Betwixt which shall our ordnance thunder forth,
     And with the breach's fall, smoke, fire, and dust,
     The crack, the echo, and the soldiers' cry,
     Make deaf the air and dim the crystal sky.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     Trumpets and drums, alarum presently!
     And, soldiers, play the men; the hold  is yours!</pre>

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     Come, good my lord, and let us haste from hence,
     Along the cave that leads beyond the foe:
     No hope is left to save this conquer'd hold.

     &lt;name&gt;CAPTAIN&lt;name&gt;
     A deadly bullet, gliding through my side,
     Lies heavy on my heart; I cannot live:
     I feel my liver pierc'd, and all my veins,
     That there begin and nourish every part,
     Mangled and torn, and all my entrails bath'd
     In blood that straineth  from their orifex.
     Farewell, sweet wife! sweet son, farewell! I die.


     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     Death, whither art thou gone, that both we live?
     Come back again, sweet Death, and strike us both!
     One minute and our days, and one sepulchre
     Contain our bodies!  Death, why com'st thou not
     Well, this must be the messenger for thee:
     Now, ugly Death, stretch out thy sable wings,
     And carry both our souls where his remains.
     Tell me, sweet boy, art thou content to die?
     These barbarous Scythians, full of cruelty,
     And Moors, in whom was never pity found,
     Will hew us piecemeal, put us to the wheel,
     Or else invent some torture worse than that;
     Therefore die by thy loving mother's hand,
     Who gently now will lance thy ivory throat,
     And quickly rid thee both of pain and life.

     &lt;name&gt;SON&lt;name&gt;
     Mother, despatch me, or I'll kill myself;
     For think you I can live and see him dead?
     Give me your knife, good mother, or strike home: 
     The Scythians shall not tyrannize on me:
     Sweet mother, strike, that I may meet my father.


     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     Ah, sacred Mahomet, if this be sin,
     Entreat a pardon of the God of heaven,
     And purge my soul before it come to thee!





     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     How now, madam! what are you doing?

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     Killing myself, as I have done my son,
     Whose body, with his father's, I have burnt,
     Lest cruel Scythians should dismember him.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     'Twas bravely done, and like a soldier's wife.
     Thou shalt with us to Tamburlaine the Great,
     Who, when he hears how resolute thou wert, 
     Will match thee with a viceroy or a king.

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     My lord deceas'd was dearer unto me
     Than any viceroy, king, or emperor;
     And for his sake here will I end my days.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     But, lady, go with us to Tamburlaine,
     And thou shalt see a man greater than Mahomet,
     In whose high looks is much more majesty,
     Than from the concave superficies
     Of Jove's vast palace, the empyreal orb,
     Unto the shining bower where Cynthia sits,
     Like lovely Thetis, in a crystal robe;
     That treadeth Fortune underneath his feet,
     And makes the mighty god of arms his slave;
     On whom Death and the Fatal Sisters wait
     With naked swords and scarlet liveries;
     Before whom, mounted on a lion's back,
     Rhamnusia bears a helmet full of blood,
     And strows the way with brains of slaughter'd men;
     By whose proud side the ugly Furies run,
     Hearkening when he shall bid them plague the world;
     Over whose zenith, cloth'd in windy air,
     And eagle's wings join'd  to her feather'd breast,
     Fame hovereth, sounding of  her golden trump,
     That to the adverse poles of that straight line
     Which measureth the glorious frame of heaven
     The name of mighty Tamburlaine is spread;
     And him, fair lady, shall thy eyes behold.
     Come.

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     Take pity of a lady's ruthful tears,
     That humbly craves upon her knees to stay,
     And cast her body in the burning flame
     That feeds upon her son's and husband's flesh.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     Madam, sooner shall fire consume us both
     Than scorch a face so beautiful as this,
     In frame of which Nature hath shew'd more skill
     Than when she gave eternal chaos form,
     Drawing from it the shining lamps of heaven.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Madam, I am so far in love with you,
     That you must go with us:  no remedy.

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     Then carry me, I care not, where you will,
     And let the end of this my fatal journey
     Be likewise end to my accursed life.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     No, madam, but the  beginning of your joy:
     Come willingly therefore.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Soldiers, now let us meet the general,
     Who by this time is at Natolia,
     Ready to charge the army of the Turk.
     The gold and  silver, and the pearl, ye got,
     Rifling this fort, divide in equal shares:
     This lady shall have twice so much again
     Out of the coffers of our treasury.</pre>

     &lt;name&gt;MESSENGER&lt;name&gt;
     Renowmed  emperor, mighty  Callapine,
     God's great lieutenant over all the world,
     Here at Aleppo, with an host of men,
     Lies Tamburlaine, this king of Persia,
     (In number more than are the  quivering leaves
     Of Ida's forest, where your highness' hounds
     With open cry pursue the wounded stag,)
     Who means to girt Natolia's walls with siege,
     Fire the town, and over-run the land.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     My royal army is as great as his,
     That, from the bounds of Phrygia to the sea
     Which washeth Cyprus with his brinish waves,
     Covers the hills, the valleys, and the plains.
     Viceroys and peers of Turkey, play the men;
     Whet all your  swords to mangle Tamburlaine,
     His sons, his captains, and his followers:
     By Mahomet, not one of them shall live!
     The field wherein this battle shall be fought
     For ever term'd  the Persians' sepulchre,
     In memory of this our victory.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Now he that calls himself the  scourge of Jove,
     The emperor of the world, and earthly god,
     Shall end the warlike progress he intends,
     And travel headlong to the lake of hell,
     Where legions of devils (knowing he must die
     Here in Natolia by your  highness' hands),
     All brandishing their  brands of quenchless fire,
     Stretching their monstrous paws, grin with  their teeth,
     And guard the gates to entertain his soul.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Tell me, viceroys, the number of your men,
     And what our army royal is esteem'd.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF JERUSALEM&lt;name&gt;
     From Palestina and Jerusalem,
     Of Hebrews three score thousand fighting men
     Are come, since last we shew'd your  majesty.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     So from Arabia Desert, and the bounds
     Of that sweet land whose brave metropolis
     Re-edified the fair Semiramis,
     Came forty thousand warlike foot and horse,
     Since last we number'd to your majesty.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF TREBIZON&lt;name&gt;
     From Trebizon in Asia the Less,
     Naturaliz'd Turks and stout Bithynians
     Came to my bands, full fifty thousand more,
     (That, fighting, know not what retreat doth mean,
     Nor e'er return but with the victory,)
     Since last we number'd to your majesty.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF SORIA&lt;name&gt;
     Of Sorians  from Halla is repair'd,
     And neighbour cities of your highness' land, 
     Ten thousand horse, and thirty thousand foot,
     Since last we number'd to your majesty;
     So that the army royal is esteem'd
     Six hundred thousand valiant fighting men.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Then welcome, Tamburlaine, unto thy death!
     Come, puissant viceroys, let us to the field
     (The Persians' sepulchre), and sacrifice
     Mountains of breathless men to Mahomet,
     Who now, with Jove, opens the firmament
     To see the slaughter of our enemies.




     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     How now, Casane! see, a knot of kings,
     Sitting as if they were a-telling riddles!

     &lt;name&gt;USUMCASANE&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, your presence makes them pale and wan:
     Poor souls, they look as if their deaths were near.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Why, so he  is, Casane; I am here:
     But yet I'll save their lives, and make them slaves.
     Ye petty kings of Turkey, I am come,
     As Hector did into the Grecian camp,
     To overdare the pride of Graecia,
     And set his warlike person to the view
     Of fierce Achilles, rival of his fame:
     I do you honour in the simile;
     For, if I should, as Hector did Achilles,
     (The worthiest knight that ever brandish'd sword,)
     Challenge in combat any of you all,
     I see how fearfully ye would refuse,
     And fly my glove as from a scorpion.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Now, thou art fearful of thy army's strength,
     Thou wouldst with overmatch of person fight:
     But, shepherd's issue, base-born Tamburlaine,
     Think of thy end; this sword shall lance thy throat.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Villain, the shepherd's issue (at whose birth
     Heaven did afford a gracious aspect,
     And join'd those stars that shall be opposite
     Even till the dissolution of the world,
     And never meant to make a conqueror
     So famous as is  mighty Tamburlaine)
     Shall so torment thee, and that Callapine,
     That, like a roguish runaway, suborn'd
     That villain there, that slave, that Turkish dog,
     To false his service to his sovereign,
     As ye shall curse the birth of Tamburlaine.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Rail not, proud Scythian:  I shall now revenge
     My father's vile abuses and mine own.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF JERUSALEM&lt;name&gt;
     By Mahomet, he shall be tied in chains,
     Rowing with Christians in a brigandine
     About the Grecian isles to rob and spoil,
     And turn him to his ancient trade again:
     Methinks the slave should make a lusty thief.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Nay, when the battle ends, all we will meet,
     And sit in council to invent some pain
     That most may vex his body and his soul.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Sirrah Callapine, I'll hang a clog about
     your neck for running away again:  you shall not
     trouble me thus to come and fetch you.
     But as for you, viceroy, you shall have bits,
     And, harness'd  like my horses, draw my coach;
     And, when ye stay, be lash'd with whips of wire:
     I'll have you learn to feed on  provender,
     And in a stable lie upon the planks.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     But, Tamburlaine, first thou shalt  kneel to us,
     And humbly crave a pardon for thy life.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF TREBIZON&lt;name&gt;
     The common soldiers of our mighty host
     Shall bring thee bound unto the  general's tent 

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF SORIA&lt;name&gt;
     And all have jointly sworn thy cruel death,
     Or bind thee in eternal torments' wrath.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Well, sirs, diet yourselves; you know I
     shall have occasion shortly to journey you.

     &lt;name&gt;CELEBINUS&lt;name&gt;
     See, father, how Almeda the jailor looks upon us!

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Villain, traitor, damned fugitive,
     I'll make thee wish the earth had swallow'd thee!
     See'st thou not death within my wrathful looks?
     Go, villain, cast thee headlong from a rock,
     Or rip thy bowels, and rent  out thy heart,
     T' appease my wrath; or else I'll torture thee,
     Searing thy hateful flesh with burning irons
     And drops of scalding lead, while all thy joints
     Be rack'd and beat asunder with the wheel;
     For, if thou liv'st, not any element
     Shall shroud thee from the wrath of Tamburlaine.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Well, in despite of thee, he shall be king.
     Come, Almeda; receive this crown of me:
     I here invest thee king of Ariadan,
     Bordering on Mare Roso, near to Mecca.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     What! take it, man.

     &lt;name&gt;ALMEDA&lt;name&gt;
     Good my lord, let me take it.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Dost thou ask him leave? here; take it.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Go to, sirrah!  take your crown, and make up
     the half dozen.  So, sirrah, now you are a king, you must give
     arms. 

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     So he shall, and wear thy head in his scutcheon.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     No;  let him hang a bunch of keys on his
     standard, to put him in remembrance he was a jailor, that,
     when I take him, I may knock out his brains with them,
     and lock you in the stable, when you shall come sweating
     from my chariot.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF TREBIZON&lt;name&gt;
     Away! let us to the field, that the villain
     may be slain.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Sirrah, prepare whips, and bring my chariot
     to my tent; for, as soon as the battle is done, I'll ride
     in triumph through the camp.

     How now, ye petty kings? lo, here are bugs 
     Will make the hair stand upright on your heads,
     And cast your crowns in slavery at their feet!
     Welcome, Theridamas and Techelles, both:
     See ye this rout,  and know ye this same king?

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Ay, my lord; he was Callapine's keeper.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Well, now ye see he is a king.  Look to him,
     Theridamas, when we are fighting, lest he hide his crown
     as the foolish king of Persia did. 

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF SORIA&lt;name&gt;
     No, Tamburlaine; he shall not be put
     to that exigent, I warrant thee.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     You know not, sir.
     But now, my followers and my loving friends,
     Fight as you ever did, like conquerors,
     The glory of this happy day is yours.
     My stern aspect  shall make fair Victory,
     Hovering betwixt our armies, light on me,
     Loaden with laurel-wreaths to crown us all.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     I smile to think how, when this field is fought
     And rich Natolia ours, our men shall sweat
     With carrying pearl and treasure on their backs.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     You shall be princes all, immediately.
     Come, fight, ye Turks, or yield us victory.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     No; we will meet thee, slavish Tamburlaine.</pre>

      SCENE I.
    </h2>
<pre>



     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     Now in their glories shine the golden crowns
     Of these proud Turks, much like so many suns
     That half dismay the majesty of heaven.
     Now, brother, follow we our father's sword,
     That flies with fury swifter than our thoughts,
     And cuts down armies with his conquering wings.

     &lt;name&gt;CELEBINUS&lt;name&gt;
     Call forth our lazy brother from the tent,
     For, if my father miss him in the field,
     Wrath, kindled in the furnace of his breast,
     Will send a deadly lightning to his heart.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     Brother, ho! what, given so much to sleep,
     You cannot  leave it, when our enemies' drums
     And rattling cannons thunder in our ears
     Our proper ruin and our father's foil?

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     Away, ye fools! my father needs not me,
     Nor you, in faith, but that you will be thought
     More childish-valourous than manly-wise.
     If half our camp should sit and sleep with me,
     My father were enough to scare  the foe:
     You do dishonour to his majesty,
     To think our helps will do him any good.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     What, dar'st thou, then, be absent from the fight,
     Knowing my father hates thy cowardice,
     And oft hath warn'd thee to be still in field,
     When he himself amidst the thickest troops
     Beats down our foes, to flesh our taintless swords?

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     I know, sir, what it is to kill a man;
     It works remorse of conscience in me.
     I take no pleasure to be murderous,
     Nor care for blood when wine will quench my thirst.

     &lt;name&gt;CELEBINUS&lt;name&gt;
     O cowardly boy! fie, for shame, come forth!
     Thou dost dishonour manhood and thy house.

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     Go, go, tall  stripling, fight you for us both,
     And take my other toward brother here,
     For person like to prove a second Mars.
     'Twill please my mind as well to hear, both you 
     Have won a heap of honour in the field,
     And left your slender carcasses behind,
     As if I lay with you for company.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     You will not go, then?

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     You say true.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     Were all the lofty mounts of Zona Mundi
     That fill the midst of farthest Tartary
     Turn'd into pearl and proffer'd for my stay,
     I would not bide the fury of my father,
     When, made a victor in these haughty arms,
     He comes and finds his sons have had no shares
     In all the honours he propos'd for us.

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     Take you the honour, I will take my ease;
     My wisdom shall excuse my cowardice:
     I go into the field before I need!

     The bullets fly at random where they list;
     And, should I  go, and kill a thousand men,
     I were as soon rewarded with a shot,
     And sooner far than he that never fights;
     And, should I go, and do no harm nor good,
     I might have harm, which all the good I have,
     Join'd with my father's crown, would never cure.
     I'll to cards.—Perdicas!



     &lt;name&gt;PERDICAS&lt;name&gt;
     Here, my lord.

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     
     Come, thou and I will go to cards to drive away the time.

     &lt;name&gt;PERDICAS&lt;name&gt;
     Content, my lord:  but what shall we play for?

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     Who shall kiss the fairest of the Turks' concubines
     first, when my father hath conquered them.

     &lt;name&gt;PERDICAS&lt;name&gt;
     Agreed, i'faith.


     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     They say I am a coward, Perdicas, and I fear
     as little their taratantaras, their swords, or their cannons
     as I do a naked lady in a net of gold, and, for fear I should be
     afraid, would put it off and come to bed with me.

     &lt;name&gt;PERDICAS&lt;name&gt;
     Such a fear, my lord, would never make ye retire.

     &lt;name&gt;CALYPHAS&lt;name&gt;
     I would my father would let me be put in the front
     of such a battle once, to try my valour!  
     What a coil they keep!  I believe there will be some hurt done
     anon amongst them.





     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     
     See now, ye  slaves, my children stoop your pride, 
     And lead your bodies  sheep-like to the sword!
     Bring them, my boys, and tell me if the wars
     Be not a life that may illustrate gods,
     And tickle not your spirits with desire
     Still to be train'd in arms and chivalry?

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     Shall we let go these kings again, my lord,
     To gather greater numbers 'gainst our power,
     That they may say, it is not chance doth this,
     But matchless strength and magnanimity?

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     No, no, Amyras; tempt not Fortune so:
     Cherish thy valour still with fresh supplies,
     And glut it not with stale and daunted foes.
     But where's this coward villain, not my son,
     But traitor to my name and majesty?

     Image of sloth, and picture of a slave,
     The obloquy and scorn of my renown!
     How may my heart, thus fired with mine  eyes,
     Wounded with shame and kill'd with discontent,
     Shroud any thought may  hold my striving hands
     ]From martial justice on thy wretched soul?

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Yet pardon him, I pray your majesty.

     TECHELLES and USUMCASANE.
     Let all of us entreat your highness' pardon.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Stand up,  ye base, unworthy soldiers!
     Know ye not yet the argument of arms?

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     Good my lord, let him be forgiven for once,
     And we will force him to the field hereafter.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Stand up, my boys, and I will teach ye arms,
     And what the jealousy of wars must do.
     O Samarcanda, where I breathed first,
     And joy'd the fire of this martial  flesh,
     Blush, blush, fair city, at thine  honour's foil,
     And shame of nature, which  Jaertis'  stream,
     Embracing thee with deepest of his love,
     Can never wash from thy distained brows!
     Here, Jove, receive his fainting soul again;
     A form not meet to give that subject essence
     Whose matter is the flesh of Tamburlaine,
     Wherein an incorporeal  spirit moves,
     Made of the mould whereof thyself consists,
     Which makes me valiant, proud, ambitious,
     Ready to levy power against thy throne,
     That I might move the turning spheres of heaven;
     For earth and all this airy region
     Cannot contain the state of Tamburlaine.

     By Mahomet, thy mighty friend, I swear,
     In sending to my issue such a soul,
     Created of the massy dregs of earth,
     The scum and tartar of the elements,
     Wherein was neither courage, strength, or wit,
     But folly, sloth, and damned idleness,
     Thou hast procur'd a greater enemy
     Than he that darted mountains at thy head,
     Shaking the burden mighty Atlas bears,
     Whereat thou trembling hidd'st thee in the air,
     Cloth'd with a pitchy cloud for being seen.— 
     And now, ye canker'd curs of Asia,
     That will not see the strength of Tamburlaine,
     Although it shine as brightly as the sun,
     Now you shall  feel the strength of Tamburlaine,
     And, by the state of his supremacy,
     Approve  the difference 'twixt himself and you.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Thou shew'st the difference 'twixt ourselves and thee,
     In this thy barbarous damned tyranny.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF JERUSALEM&lt;name&gt;
     Thy victories are grown so violent,
     That shortly heaven, fill'd with the meteors
     Of blood and fire thy tyrannies have made,
     Will pour down blood and fire on thy head,
     Whose scalding drops will pierce thy seething brains,
     And, with our bloods, revenge our bloods  on thee.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Villains, these terrors, and these tyrannies
     (If tyrannies war's justice ye repute),
     I execute, enjoin'd me from above,
     To scourge the pride of such as Heaven abhors;
     Nor am I made arch-monarch of the world,
     Crown'd and invested by the hand of Jove,
     For deeds of bounty or nobility;
     But, since I exercise a greater name,
     The scourge of God and terror of the world,
     I must apply myself to fit those terms,
     In war, in blood, in death, in cruelty,
     And plague such peasants  as resist in  me
     The power of Heaven's eternal majesty.
     Theridamas, Techelles, and Casane, 
     Ransack the tents and the pavilions
     Of these proud Turks, and take their concubines,
     Making them bury this effeminate brat;
     For not a common soldier shall defile
     His manly fingers with so faint a boy:
     Then bring those Turkish harlots to my tent,
     And I'll dispose them as it likes me best.
     Meanwhile, take him in.

     &lt;name&gt;SOLDIERS&lt;name&gt;
     We will, my lord.


     &lt;name&gt;KING OF JERUSALEM&lt;name&gt;
     O damned monster! nay, a fiend of hell,
     Whose cruelties are not so harsh as thine,
     Nor yet impos'd with such a bitter hate!

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Revenge it,  Rhadamanth and Aeacus,
     And let your hates, extended in his pains,
     Excel  the hate wherewith he pains our souls!

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF TREBIZON&lt;name&gt;
     May never day give virtue to his eyes,
     Whose sight, compos'd of fury and of fire,
     Doth send such stern affections to his heart!

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF SORIA&lt;name&gt;
     May never spirit, vein, or artier,  feed
     The cursed substance of that cruel heart;
     But, wanting moisture and remorseful  blood,
     Dry up with anger, and consume with heat!

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Well, bark, ye dogs:  I'll bridle all your tongues,
     And bind them close with bits of burnish'd steel,
     Down to the channels of your hateful throats;
     And, with the pains my rigour shall inflict,
     I'll make ye roar, that earth may echo forth
     The far-resounding torments ye sustain;
     As when an herd of lusty Cimbrian bulls
     Run mourning round about the females' miss, 
     And, stung with fury of their following,
     Fill all the air with troublous bellowing.
     I will, with engines never exercis'd,
     Conquer, sack, and utterly consume
     Your cities and your golden palaces,
     And, with the flames that beat against the clouds,
     Incense the heavens, and make the stars to melt,
     As if they were the tears of Mahomet
     For hot consumption of his country's pride;
     And, till by vision or by speech I hear
     Immortal Jove say "Cease, my Tamburlaine,"
     I will persist a terror to the world,
     Making the meteors (that, like armed men,
     Are seen to march upon the towers of heaven)
     Run tilting round about the firmament,
     And break their burning lances in the air,
     For honour of my wondrous victories.
     Come, bring them in to our pavilion.</pre>

     Distress'd Olympia, whose weeping eyes,

     Whose drift is only to dishonour thee;
     And, since this earth, dew'd with thy brinish tears,
     Affords no herbs whose taste may poison thee,
     Nor yet this air, beat often with thy sighs,
     Contagious smells and vapours to infect thee,
     Nor thy close cave a sword to murder thee,
     Let this invention be the instrument.



     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Well met, Olympia:  I sought thee in my tent,
     But, when I saw the place obscure and dark,
     Which with thy beauty thou wast wont to light,
     Enrag'd, I ran about the fields for thee,
     Supposing amorous Jove had sent his son,
     The winged Hermes, to convey thee hence;
     But now I find thee, and that fear is past,
     Tell me, Olympia, wilt thou grant my suit?

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     My lord and husband's death, with my sweet son's,
     (With whom I buried all affections
     Save grief and sorrow, which torment my heart,)
     Forbids my mind to entertain a thought
     That tends to love, but meditate on death,
     A fitter subject for a pensive soul.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Olympia, pity him in whom thy looks
     Have greater operation and more force
     Than Cynthia's in the watery wilderness;
     For with thy view my joys are at the full,
     And ebb again as thou depart'st from me.

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     Ah, pity me, my lord, and draw your sword,
     Making a passage for my troubled soul,
     Which beats against this prison to get out,
     And meet my husband and my loving son!

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Nothing but still thy husband and thy son?
     Leave this, my love, and listen more to me:
     Thou shalt be stately queen of fair Argier;
     And, cloth'd in costly cloth of massy gold,
     Upon the marble turrets of my court
     Sit like to Venus in her chair of state,
     Commanding all thy princely eye desires;
     And I will cast off arms to  sit with thee,
     Spending my life in sweet discourse of love.

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     No such discourse is pleasant in  mine ears,
     But that where every period ends with death,
     And every line begins with death again:
     I cannot love, to be an emperess.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Nay, lady, then, if nothing will prevail,
     I'll use some other means to make you yield:
     Such is the sudden fury of my love,
     I must and will be pleas'd, and you shall yield:
     Come to the tent again.

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     Stay now, my lord; and, will you  save my honour,
     I'll give your grace a present of such price
     As all the world can not afford the like.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     What is it?

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     An ointment which a cunning alchymist
     Distilled from the purest balsamum
     And simplest extracts of all minerals,
     In which the essential form of marble stone,
     Temper'd by science metaphysical,
     And spells of magic from the mouths  of spirits,
     With which if you but 'noint your tender skin,
     Nor pistol, sword, nor lance, can pierce your flesh.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Why, madam, think you to mock me thus palpably?

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     To prove it, I will 'noint my naked throat,
     Which when you stab, look on your weapon's point,
     And you shall see't rebated  with the blow.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Why gave you not your husband some of it,
     If you lov'd him, and it so precious?

     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     My purpose was, my lord, to spend it so,
     But was prevented by his sudden end;
     And for a present easy proof thereof, 
     That I dissemble not, try it on me.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     I will, Olympia, and will  keep it for
     The richest present of this eastern world.


     &lt;name&gt;OLYMPIA&lt;name&gt;
     Now stab, my lord, and mark your weapon's point,
     That will be blunted if the blow be great.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Here, then, Olympia.

     What, have I slain her?  Villain, stab thyself!
     Cut off this arm that at murdered my  love,
     In whom the learned Rabbis of this age
     Might find as many wondrous miracles
     As in the theoria of the world!
     Now hell is fairer than Elysium; 
     A greater lamp than that bright eye of heaven,
     ]From whence the stars do borrow  all their light,
     Wanders about the black circumference;
     And now the damned souls are free from pain,
     For every Fury gazeth on her looks;
     Infernal Dis is courting of my love,
     Inventing masks and stately shows for her,
     Opening the doors of his rich treasury
     To entertain this queen of chastity;
     Whose body shall be tomb'd with all the pomp
     The treasure of my  kingdom may afford.</pre>

<h2>
      SCENE III.
    </h2>
<pre>








     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Holla, ye pamper'd jades of Asia!
     What, can ye draw but twenty miles a-day,
     And have so proud a chariot at your heels,
     And such a coachman as great Tamburlaine,
     But from Asphaltis, where I conquer'd you,
     To Byron here, where thus I honour you?
     The horse that guide the golden eye of heaven,
     And blow the morning from their nostrils, 
     Making their fiery gait above the clouds,
     Are not so honour'd in  their governor
     As you, ye slaves, in mighty Tamburlaine.
     The headstrong jades of Thrace Alcides tam'd,
     That King Aegeus fed with human flesh,
     And made so wanton that they knew their strengths,
     Were not subdu'd with valour more divine
     Than you by this unconquer'd arm of mine.
     To make you fierce, and fit my appetite,
     You shall be fed with flesh as raw as blood,
     And drink in pails the strongest muscadel:
     If you can live with it, then live, and draw
     My chariot swifter than the racking  clouds;
     If not, then die like beasts, and fit for naught
     But perches for the black and fatal ravens.
     Thus am I right the scourge of highest Jove;
     And see the figure of my dignity,
     By which I hold my name and majesty!

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     Let me have coach,  my lord, that I may ride,
     And thus be drawn by  these two idle kings.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Thy youth forbids such ease, my kingly boy:
     They shall to-morrow draw my chariot,
     While these their fellow-kings may be refresh'd.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     O thou that sway'st the region under earth,
     And art a king as absolute as Jove,
     Come as thou didst in fruitful Sicily,
     Surveying all the glories of the land,
     And as thou took'st the fair Proserpina,
     Joying the fruit of Ceres' garden-plot, 
     For love, for honour, and to make her queen,
     So, for just hate, for shame, and to subdue
     This proud contemner of thy dreadful power,
     Come once in fury, and survey his pride,
     Haling him headlong to the lowest hell!

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Your majesty must get some bits for these,
     To bridle their contemptuous cursing tongues,
     That, like unruly never-broken jades,
     Break through the hedges of their hateful mouths,
     And pass their fixed bounds exceedingly.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     Nay, we will break the hedges of their mouths,
     And pull their kicking colts  out of their pastures.

     &lt;name&gt;USUMCASANE&lt;name&gt;
     Your majesty already hath devis'd
     A mean, as fit as may be, to restrain
     These coltish coach-horse tongues from blasphemy.

     &lt;name&gt;CELEBINUS&lt;name&gt;
     How like you that, sir king? why speak you not?

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF JERUSALEM&lt;name&gt;
     Ah, cruel brat, sprung from a tyrant's loins!
     How like his cursed father he begins
     To practice taunts and bitter tyrannies!

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Ay, Turk, I tell thee, this same  boy is he
     That must (advanc'd in higher pomp than this)
     Rifle the kingdoms I shall leave unsack'd,
     If Jove, esteeming me too good for earth,
     Raise me, to match  the fair Aldeboran,
     Above  the threefold astracism of heaven,
     Before I conquer all the triple world.
     Now fetch me out the Turkish concubines:
     I will prefer them for the funeral
     They have bestow'd on my abortive son.

     Where are my common soldiers now, that fought
     So lion-like upon Asphaltis' plains?

     &lt;name&gt;SOLDIERS&lt;name&gt;
     Here, my lord.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     
     Hold ye, tall  soldiers, take ye queens a-piece,
     I mean such queens as were kings' concubines;
     Take them; divide them, and their  jewels too,
     And let them equally serve all your turns.

     &lt;name&gt;SOLDIERS&lt;name&gt;
     We thank your majesty.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Brawl not, I warn you, for your lechery;
     For every man that so offends shall die.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     Injurious tyrant, wilt thou so defame
     The hateful fortunes of thy victory,
     To exercise upon such guiltless dames
     The violence of thy common soldiers' lust?

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     
     Live continent,  then, ye slaves, and meet not me
     With troops of harlots at your slothful heels.

     &lt;name&gt;CONCUBINES&lt;name&gt;
     O, pity us, my lord, and save our honours!

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Are ye not gone, ye villains, with your spoils?


     &lt;name&gt;KING OF JERUSALEM&lt;name&gt;
     O, merciless, infernal cruelty!

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Save your honours! 'twere but time indeed,
     Lost long before ye knew what honour meant.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     It seems they meant to conquer us, my lord,
     And make us jesting pageants for their trulls.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     And now themselves shall make our pageant,
     And common soldiers jest  with all their trulls.
     Let them take pleasure soundly in their spoils,
     Till we prepare our march to Babylon,
     Whither we next make expedition.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     Let us not be idle, then, my lord,
     But presently be prest  to conquer it.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     We will, Techelles.—Forward, then, ye jades!
     Now crouch, ye kings of greatest Asia,
     And tremble, when ye hear this scourge will come
     That whips down cities and controlleth crowns,
     Adding their wealth and treasure to my store.
     The Euxine sea, north to Natolia;
     The Terrene,  west; the Caspian, north northeast;
     And on the south, Sinus Arabicus;
     Shall all  be loaden with the martial spoils
     We will convey with us to Persia.
     Then shall my native city Samarcanda,
     And crystal waves of fresh Jaertis'  stream,
     The pride and beauty of her princely seat,
     Be famous through the furthest  continents;
     For there my palace royal shall be plac'd,
     Whose shining turrets shall dismay the heavens,
     And cast the fame of Ilion's tower to hell:
     Thorough  the streets, with troops of conquer'd kings,
     I'll ride in golden armour like the sun;
     And in my helm a triple plume shall spring,
     Spangled with diamonds, dancing in the air,
     To note me emperor of the three-fold world;
     Like to an almond-tree  y-mounted  high
     Upon the lofty and celestial mount
     Of ever-green Selinus,  quaintly deck'd
     With blooms more white than Erycina's  brows, 
     Whose tender blossoms tremble every one
     At every little breath that thorough heaven  is blown.
     Then in my coach, like Saturn's royal son
     Mounted his shining chariot  gilt with fire,
     And drawn with princely eagles through the path
     Pav'd with bright crystal and enchas'd with stars,
     When all the gods stand gazing at his pomp,
     So will I ride through Samarcanda-streets,
     Until my soul, dissever'd from this flesh,
     Shall mount the milk-white way, and meet him there.
     To Babylon, my lords, to Babylon!</pre>

      SCENE I.
    </h2>
<pre>



     &lt;name&gt;GOVERNOR&lt;name&gt;
     What saith Maximus?

     &lt;name&gt;MAXIMUS&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, the breach the enemy hath made
     Gives such assurance of our overthrow,
     That little hope is left to save our lives,
     Or hold our city from the conqueror's hands.
     Then hang out  flags, my lord, of humble truce,
     And satisfy the people's general prayers,
     That Tamburlaine's intolerable wrath
     May be suppress'd by our submission.

     &lt;name&gt;GOVERNOR&lt;name&gt;
     Villain, respect'st thou  more thy slavish life
     Than honour of thy country or thy name?
     Is not my life and state as dear to me,
     The city and my native country's weal,
     As any thing of  price with thy conceit?
     Have we not hope, for all our batter'd walls,
     To live secure and keep his forces out,
     When this our famous lake of Limnasphaltis
     Makes walls a-fresh with every thing that falls
     Into the liquid substance of his stream,
     More strong than are the gates of death or hell?
     What faintness should dismay our courages,
     When we are thus defenc'd against our foe,
     And have no terror but his threatening looks?



     &lt;name&gt;CITIZEN&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, if ever you did deed of ruth,
     And now will work a refuge to our lives,
     Offer submission, hang up flags of truce,
     That Tamburlaine may pity our distress,
     And use us like a loving conqueror.
     Though this be held his last day's dreadful siege,
     Wherein he spareth neither man nor child,
     Yet are there Christians of Georgia here,
     Whose state he  ever pitied and reliev'd,
     Will get his pardon, if your grace would send.

     &lt;name&gt;GOVERNOR&lt;name&gt;
     How  is my soul environed!
     And this eterniz'd  city Babylon
     Fill'd with a pack of faint-heart fugitives
     That thus entreat their shame and servitude!



     &lt;name&gt;SECOND CITIZEN&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, if ever you will win our hearts,
     Yield up the town, and  save our wives and children;
     For I will cast myself from off these walls,
     Or die some death of quickest violence,
     Before I bide the wrath of Tamburlaine.

     &lt;name&gt;GOVERNOR&lt;name&gt;
     Villains, cowards, traitors to our state!
     Fall to the earth, and pierce the pit of hell,
     That legions of tormenting spirits may vex
     Your slavish bosoms with continual pains!
     I care not, nor the town will never yield
     As long as any life is in my breast.



     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Thou desperate governor of Babylon,
     To save thy life, and us a little labour,
     Yield speedily the city to our hands,
     Or else be sure thou shalt be forc'd with pains
     More exquisite than ever traitor felt.

     &lt;name&gt;GOVERNOR&lt;name&gt;
     Tyrant, I turn the traitor in thy throat,
     And will defend it in despite of thee.
     Call up the soldiers to defend these walls.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     Yield, foolish governor; we offer more
     Than ever yet we did to such proud slaves
     As durst resist us till our third day's siege.
     Thou seest us prest  to give the last assault,
     And that shall bide no more regard of parle. 

     &lt;name&gt;GOVERNOR&lt;name&gt;
     Assault and spare not; we will never yield.







     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     The stately buildings of fair Babylon,
     Whose lofty pillars, higher than the clouds,
     Were wont to guide the seaman in the deep,
     Being carried thither by the cannon's force,
     Now fill the mouth of Limnasphaltis' lake,
     And make a bridge unto the batter'd walls.
     Where Belus, Ninus, and great Alexander
     Have rode in triumph, triumphs Tamburlaine,
     Whose chariot-wheels have burst  th' Assyrians' bones,
     Drawn with these kings on heaps of carcasses.
     Now in the place, where fair Semiramis,
     Courted by kings and peers of Asia,
     Hath trod the measures,  do my soldiers march;
     And in the streets, where brave Assyrian dames
     Have rid in pomp like rich Saturnia,
     With furious words and frowning visages
     My horsemen brandish their unruly blades.


     Who have ye there, my lords?

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     The sturdy governor of Babylon,
     That made us all the labour for the town,
     And us'd such slender reckoning of  your majesty.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Go, bind the villain; he shall hang in chains
     Upon the ruins of this conquer'd town.
     Sirrah, the view of our vermilion tents
     (Which threaten'd more than if the region
     Next underneath the element of fire
     Were full of comets and of blazing stars,
     Whose flaming trains should reach down to the earth)
     Could not affright you; no, nor I myself,
     The wrathful messenger of mighty Jove,
     That with his sword hath quail'd all earthly kings,
     Could not persuade you to submission,
     But still the ports  were shut:  villain, I say,
     Should I but touch the rusty gates of hell,
     The triple-headed Cerberus would howl,
     And make  black Jove to crouch and kneel to me;
     But I have sent volleys of shot to you,
     Yet could not enter till the breach was made.

     &lt;name&gt;GOVERNOR&lt;name&gt;
     Nor, if my body could have stopt the breach,
     Shouldst thou have enter'd, cruel Tamburlaine.
     'Tis not thy bloody tents can make me yield,
     Nor yet thyself, the anger of the Highest;
     For, though thy cannon shook the city-walls, 
     My heart did never quake, or courage faint.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Well, now I'll make it quake.—Go draw him  up,
     Hang him in  chains upon the city-walls,
     And let my soldiers shoot the slave to death.

     &lt;name&gt;GOVERNOR&lt;name&gt;
     Vile monster, born of some infernal hag,
     And sent from hell to tyrannize on earth,
     Do all thy worst; nor death, nor Tamburlaine,
     Torture, or pain, can daunt my dreadless mind.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Up with him, then! his body shall be scar'd.

     &lt;name&gt;GOVERNOR&lt;name&gt;
     But, Tamburlaine, in Limnasphaltis' lake
     There lies more gold than Babylon is worth,
     Which, when the city was besieg'd, I hid:
     Save but my life, and I will give it thee.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     
     Then, for all your valour, you would save your life?
     Whereabout lies it?

     &lt;name&gt;GOVERNOR&lt;name&gt;
     Under a hollow bank, right opposite
     Against the western gate of Babylon.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Go thither, some of you, and take his gold:
     The rest forward with execution.
     Away with him hence, let him speak no more.
     I think I make your courage something quail.
     When this is done, we'll march from Babylon,
     And make our greatest haste to Persia.
     These jades are broken-winded and half-tir'd;
     Unharness them, and let me have fresh horse.
     So; now their best is done to honour me,
     Take them and hang them both up presently.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF TREBIZON&lt;name&gt;
     Vile  tyrant! barbarous bloody Tamburlaine!

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Take them away, Theridamas; see them despatch'd.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     I will, my lord.


     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Come, Asian viceroys; to your tasks a while,
     And take such fortune as your fellows felt.

     &lt;name&gt;ORCANES&lt;name&gt;
     First let thy Scythian horse tear both our limbs,
     Rather than we should draw thy chariot,
     And, like base slaves, abject our princely minds
     To vile and ignominious servitude.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF JERUSALEM&lt;name&gt;
     Rather lend me thy weapon, Tamburlaine,
     That I may sheathe it in this breast of mine.
     A thousand deaths could not torment our hearts
     More than the thought of this doth vex our souls.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     
     They will talk still, my lord, if you do not bridle them.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Bridle them, and let me to my coach.






     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     See, now, my lord, how brave the captain hangs!

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     'Tis brave indeed, my boy:—well done!
     Shoot first, my lord, and then the rest shall follow.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Then have at him, to begin withal.


     &lt;name&gt;GOVERNOR&lt;name&gt;
     Yet save my life, and let this wound appease
     The mortal fury of great Tamburlaine!

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     No, though Asphaltis' lake were liquid gold,
     And offer'd me as ransom for thy life,
     Yet shouldst thou die.—Shoot at him all at once.
     So, now he hangs like Bagdet's  governor,
     Having as many bullets in his flesh
     As there be breaches in her batter'd wall.
     Go now, and bind the burghers hand and foot,
     And cast them headlong in the city's lake.
     Tartars and Persians shall inhabit there;
     And, to command the city, I will build
     A citadel,  that all Africa,
     Which hath been subject to the Persian king,
     Shall pay me tribute for in Babylon.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     
     What shall be done with their wives and children, my lord?

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Techelles, drown them all, man, woman, and child;
     Leave not a Babylonian in the town.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     I will about it straight.—Come, soldiers.


     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Now, Casane, where's the Turkish Alcoran,
     And all the heaps of superstitious books
     Found in the temples of that Mahomet
     Whom I have thought a god? they shall be burnt.

     &lt;name&gt;USUMCASANE&lt;name&gt;
     Here they are, my lord.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Well said!  let there be a fire presently.
     In vain, I see, men worship Mahomet:
     My sword hath sent millions of Turks to hell,
     Slew all his priests, his kinsmen, and his friends,
     And yet I live untouch'd by Mahomet.
     There is a God, full of revenging wrath,
     ]From whom the thunder and the lightning breaks,
     Whose scourge I am, and him will I  obey.
     So, Casane; fling them in the fire.
     Now, Mahomet, if thou have any power,
     Come down thyself and work a miracle:
     Thou art not worthy to be worshipped
     That suffer'st  flames of fire to burn the writ
     Wherein the sum of thy religion rests:
     Why send'st  thou not a furious whirlwind down,
     To blow thy Alcoran up to thy throne,
     Where men report thou sitt'st  by God himself?
     Or vengeance on the head  of Tamburlaine
     That shakes his sword against thy majesty,
     And spurns the abstracts of thy foolish laws?
     Well, soldiers, Mahomet remains in hell;
     He cannot hear the voice of Tamburlaine:
     Seek out another godhead to adore;
     The God that sits in heaven, if any god,
     For he is God alone, and none but he.



     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     I have fulfill'd your highness' will, my lord:
     Thousands of men, drown'd in Asphaltis' lake,
     Have made the water swell above the banks,
     And fishes, fed  by human carcasses,
     Amaz'd, swim up and down upon  the waves,
     As when they swallow assafoetida,
     Which makes them fleet  aloft and gape  for air.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Well, then, my friendly lords, what now remains,
     But that we leave sufficient garrison,
     And presently depart to Persia,
     To triumph after all our victories?

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Ay, good my lord, let us in  haste to Persia;
     And let this captain be remov'd the walls
     To some high hill about the city here.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Let it be so;—about it, soldiers;
     But stay; I feel myself distemper'd suddenly.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     What is it dares distemper Tamburlaine?

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Something, Techelles; but I know not what.
     But, forth, ye vassals!  whatsoe'er  it be,
     Sickness or death can never conquer me.</pre>

      SCENE II.
    </h2>
<pre>



     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     King of Amasia, now our mighty host
     Marcheth in Asia Major, where the streams
     Of Euphrates  and Tigris swiftly run;
     And here may we  behold great Babylon,
     Circled about with Limnasphaltis' lake,
     Where Tamburlaine with all his army lies,
     Which being faint and weary with the siege,
     We may lie ready to encounter him
     Before his host be full from Babylon,
     And so revenge our latest grievous loss,
     If God or Mahomet send any aid.

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF AMASIA&lt;name&gt;
     Doubt not, my lord, but we shall conquer him:
     The monster that hath drunk a sea of blood,
     And yet gapes still for more to quench his thirst,
     Our Turkish swords shall headlong send to hell;
     And that vile carcass, drawn by warlike kings,
     The fowls shall eat; for never sepulchre
     Shall grace this  base-born tyrant Tamburlaine.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     When I record  my parents' slavish life,
     Their cruel death, mine own captivity,
     My viceroys' bondage under Tamburlaine,
     Methinks I could sustain a thousand deaths,
     To be reveng'd of all his villany.
     Ah, sacred Mahomet, thou that hast seen
     Millions of Turks perish by Tamburlaine,
     Kingdoms made waste, brave cities sack'd and burnt,
     And but one host is left to honour thee,
     Aid  thy obedient servant Callapine,
     And make him, after all these overthrows,
     To triumph over cursed Tamburlaine!

     &lt;name&gt;KING OF AMASIA&lt;name&gt;
     Fear not, my lord:  I see great Mahomet,
     Clothed in purple clouds, and on his head
     A chaplet brighter than Apollo's crown,
     Marching about the air with armed men,
     To join with you against this Tamburlaine.

     &lt;name&gt;CAPTAIN&lt;name&gt;
     Renowmed  general, mighty Callapine,
     Though God himself and holy Mahomet
     Should come in person to resist your power,
     Yet might your mighty host encounter all,
     And pull proud Tamburlaine upon his knees
     To sue for mercy at your highness' feet.

     &lt;name&gt;CALLAPINE&lt;name&gt;
     Captain, the force of Tamburlaine is great,
     His fortune greater, and the victories
     Wherewith he hath so sore dismay'd the world
     Are greatest to discourage all our drifts;
     Yet, when the pride of Cynthia is at full,
     She wanes again; and so shall his, I hope;
     For we have here the chief selected men
     Of twenty several kingdoms at the least;
     Nor ploughman, priest, nor merchant, stays at home;
     All Turkey is in arms with Callapine;
     And never will we sunder camps and arms
     Before himself or his be conquered:
     This is the time that must eternize me
     For conquering the tyrant of the world.
     Come, soldiers, let us lie in wait for him,
     And, if we find him absent from his camp,
     Or that it be rejoin'd again at full,
     Assail it, and be sure of victory.</pre>

      SCENE III.
    </h2>
<pre>


     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Weep, heavens, and vanish into liquid tears!
     Fall, stars that govern his nativity,
     And summon all the shining lamps of heaven
     To cast their bootless fires to the earth,
     And shed their feeble influence in the air;
     Muffle your beauties with eternal clouds;
     For Hell and Darkness pitch their pitchy tents,
     And Death, with armies of Cimmerian spirits,
     Gives battle 'gainst the heart of Tamburlaine!
     Now, in defiance of that wonted love
     Your sacred virtues pour'd upon his throne,
     And made his state an honour to the heavens,
     These cowards invisibly  assail his soul,
     And threaten conquest on our sovereign;
     But, if he die, your glories are disgrac'd,
     Earth droops, and says that hell in heaven is plac'd!

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     O, then, ye powers that sway eternal seats,
     And guide this massy substance of the earth,
     If you retain desert of holiness,
     As your supreme estates instruct our thoughts,
     Be not inconstant, careless of your fame,
     Bear not the burden of your enemies' joys,
     Triumphing in his fall whom you advanc'd;
     But, as his birth, life, health, and majesty
     Were strangely blest and governed by heaven,
     So honour, heaven, (till heaven dissolved be,)
     His birth, his life, his health, and majesty!

     &lt;name&gt;USUMCASANE&lt;name&gt;
     Blush, heaven, to lose the honour of thy name,
     To see thy footstool set upon thy head;
     And let no baseness in thy haughty breast
     Sustain a shame of such inexcellence, 
     To see the devils mount in angels' thrones,
     And angels dive into the pools of hell!
     And, though they think their painful date is out,
     And that their power is puissant as Jove's,
     Which makes them manage arms against thy state,
     Yet make them feel the strength of Tamburlaine
     (Thy instrument and note of majesty)
     Is greater far than they can thus subdue;
     For, if he die, thy glory is disgrac'd,
     Earth droops, and says that hell in heaven is plac'd!





     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     What daring god torments my body thus,
     And seeks to conquer mighty Tamburlaine?
     Shall sickness prove me now to be a man,
     That have been term'd the terror of the world?
     Techelles and the rest, come, take your swords,
     And threaten him whose hand afflicts my soul:
     Come, let us march against the powers of heaven,
     And set black streamers in the firmament,
     To signify the slaughter of the gods.
     Ah, friends, what shall I do? I cannot stand.
     Come, carry me to war against the gods,
     That thus envy the health of Tamburlaine.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     Ah, good my lord, leave these impatient words,
     Which add much danger to your malady!

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Why, shall I sit and languish in this pain?
     No, strike the drums, and, in revenge of this,
     Come, let us charge our spears, and pierce his breast
     Whose shoulders bear the axis of the world,
     That, if I perish, heaven and earth may fade.
     Theridamas, haste to the court of Jove;
     Will him to send Apollo hither straight,
     To cure me, or I'll fetch him down myself.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     
     Sit still, my gracious lord; this grief will cease, 
     And cannot last, it is so violent.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Not last, Techelles! no, for I shall die.
     See, where my slave, the ugly monster Death,
     Shaking and quivering, pale and wan for fear,
     Stands aiming at me with his murdering dart,
     Who flies away at every glance I give,
     And, when I look away, comes stealing on!
     Villain, away, and hie thee to the field!
     I and mine army come to load thy back
     With souls of thousand mangled carcasses.
     Look, where he goes! but, see, he comes again,
     Because I stay!  Techelles, let us march,
     And weary Death with bearing souls to hell.

     &lt;name&gt;FIRST PHYSICIAN&lt;name&gt;
     Pleaseth your majesty to drink this potion,
     Which will abate the fury of your fit,
     And cause some milder spirits govern you.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Tell me what think you of my sickness now?

     &lt;name&gt;FIRST PHYSICIAN&lt;name&gt;
     I view'd your urine, and the hypostasis,
     Thick and obscure, doth make your danger great:
     Your veins are full of accidental heat,
     Whereby the moisture of your blood is dried:
     The humidum and calor, which some hold
     Is not a parcel of the elements,
     But of a substance more divine and pure,
     Is almost clean extinguished and spent;
     Which, being the cause of life, imports your death:
     Besides, my lord, this day is critical,
     Dangerous to those whose crisis is as yours:
     Your artiers,  which alongst the veins convey
     The lively spirits which the heart engenders,
     Are parch'd and void of spirit, that the soul,
     Wanting those organons by which it moves,
     Cannot endure, by argument of art.
     Yet, if your majesty may escape this day,
     No doubt but you shall soon recover all.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Then will I comfort all my vital parts,
     And live, in spite of death, above a day.




     &lt;name&gt;MESSENGER&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, young Callapine, that lately fled
     from your majesty, hath now gathered a fresh army, and,
     hearing your absence in the field, offers to set upon  us
     presently.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     See, my physicians, now, how Jove hath sent
     A present medicine to recure my pain!
     My looks shall make them fly; and, might I follow,
     There should not one of all the villain's power
     Live to give offer of another fight.

     &lt;name&gt;USUMCASANE&lt;name&gt;
     I joy, my lord, your highness is so strong,
     That can endure so well your royal presence,
     Which only will dismay the enemy.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     I know it will, Casane.—Draw, you slaves!
     In spite of death, I will go shew my face.



     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Thus are the villain cowards  fled for fear,
     Like summer's vapours vanish'd by the sun;
     And, could I but a while pursue the field,
     That Callapine should be my slave again.
     But I perceive my martial strength is spent:
     In vain I strive and rail against those powers
     That mean t' invest me in a higher throne,
     As much too high for this disdainful earth.
     Give me a map; then let me see how much
     Is left for me to conquer all the world,
     That these, my boys, may finish all my wants.

     Here I began to march towards Persia,
     Along Armenia and the Caspian Sea,
     And thence unto  Bithynia, where I took
     The Turk and his great empress prisoners.
     Then march'd I into Egypt and Arabia;
     And here, not far from Alexandria,
     Whereas  the Terrene  and the Red Sea meet,
     Being distant less than full a hundred leagues,
     I meant to cut a channel to them both,
     That men might quickly sail to India.
     ]From thence to Nubia near Borno-lake,
     And so along the Aethiopian sea,
     Cutting the tropic line of Capricorn,
     I conquer'd all as far as Zanzibar.
     Then, by the northern part of Africa,
     I came at last to Graecia, and from thence
     To Asia, where I stay against my will;
     Which is from Scythia, where I first began, 
     Backward and forwards near five thousand leagues.
     Look here, my boys; see, what a world of ground
     Lies westward from the midst of Cancer's line
     Unto the rising of this  earthly globe,
     Whereas the sun, declining from our sight,
     Begins the day with our Antipodes!
     And shall I die, and this unconquered?
     Lo, here, my sons, are all the golden mines,
     Inestimable drugs and precious stones,
     More worth than Asia and the world beside;
     And from th' Antarctic Pole eastward behold
     As much more land, which never was descried,
     Wherein are rocks of pearl that shine as bright
     As all the lamps that beautify the sky!
     And shall I die, and this unconquered?
     Here, lovely boys; what death forbids my life,
     That let your lives command in spite of death.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     Alas, my lord, how should our bleeding hearts,
     Wounded and broken with your highness' grief,
     Retain a thought of joy or spark of life?
     Your soul gives essence to our wretched subjects, 
     Whose matter is incorporate in your flesh.

     &lt;name&gt;CELEBINUS&lt;name&gt;
     Your pains do pierce our souls; no hope survives,
     For by your life we entertain our lives.

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     But, sons, this subject, not of force enough
     To hold the fiery spirit it contains,
     Must part, imparting his impressions
     By equal portions into  both your breasts;
     My flesh, divided in your precious shapes,
     Shall still retain my spirit, though I die,
     And live in all your seeds  immortally.
     Then now remove me, that I may resign
     My place and proper title to my son.
     First, take my scourge and my imperial crown,
     And mount my royal chariot of estate,
     That I may see thee crown'd before I die.
     Help me, my lords, to make my last remove.


     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     A woful change, my lord, that daunts our thoughts
     More than the ruin of our proper souls!

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Sit up, my son,  let me see how well
     Thou wilt become thy father's majesty.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     With what a flinty bosom should I joy
     The breath of life and burden of my soul,
     If not resolv'd into resolved pains,
     My body's mortified lineaments 
     Should exercise the motions of my heart,
     Pierc'd with the joy of any dignity!
     O father, if the unrelenting ears
     Of Death and Hell be shut against my prayers,
     And that the spiteful influence of Heaven
     Deny my soul fruition of her joy,
     How should I step, or stir my hateful feet
     Against the inward powers of my heart,
     Leading a life that only strives to die,
     And plead in vain unpleasing sovereignty!

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Let not thy love exceed thine honour, son,
     Nor bar thy mind that magnanimity
     That nobly must admit necessity.
     Sit up, my boy, and with these  silken reins
     Bridle the steeled stomachs of these  jades.

     &lt;name&gt;THERIDAMAS&lt;name&gt;
     My lord, you must obey his majesty,
     Since fate commands and proud necessity.

     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     Heavens witness me with what a broken heart

     And damned  spirit I ascend this seat,
     And send my soul, before my father die,
     His anguish and his burning agony!


     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Now fetch the hearse of fair Zenocrate;
     Let it be plac'd by this my fatal chair,
     And serve as parcel of my funeral.

     &lt;name&gt;USUMCASANE&lt;name&gt;
     Then feels your majesty no sovereign ease,
     Nor may our hearts, all drown'd in tears of blood,
     Joy any hope of your recovery?

     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Casane, no; the monarch of the earth,
     And eyeless monster that torments my soul,
     Cannot behold the tears ye shed for me,
     And therefore still augments his cruelty.

     &lt;name&gt;TECHELLES&lt;name&gt;
     Then let some god oppose his holy power
     Against the wrath and tyranny of Death,
     That his tear-thirsty and unquenched hate
     May be upon himself reverberate!


     &lt;name&gt;TAMBURLAINE&lt;name&gt;
     Now, eyes, enjoy your latest benefit,
     And, when my soul hath virtue of your sight,
     Pierce through the coffin and the sheet of gold,
     And glut your longings with a heaven of joy.
     So, reign, my son; scourge and control those slaves,
     Guiding thy chariot with thy father's hand.
     As precious is the charge thou undertak'st
     As that which Clymene's  brain-sick son did guide,
     When wandering Phoebe's  ivory cheeks were scorch'd,
     And all the earth, like Aetna, breathing fire:
     Be warn'd by him, then; learn with awful eye
     To sway a throne as dangerous as his;
     For, if thy body thrive not full of thoughts
     As pure and fiery as Phyteus'  beams,
     The nature of these proud rebelling jades
     Will take occasion by the slenderest hair,
     And draw thee  piecemeal, like Hippolytus,
     Through rocks more steep and sharp than Caspian cliffs: 
     The nature of thy chariot will not bear
     A guide of baser temper than myself,
     More than heaven's coach the pride of Phaeton.
     Farewell, my boys! my dearest friends, farewell!
     My body feels, my soul doth weep to see
     Your sweet desires depriv'd my company,
     For Tamburlaine, the scourge of God, must die.


     &lt;name&gt;AMYRAS&lt;name&gt;
     Meet heaven and earth, and here let all things end,
     For earth hath spent the pride of all her fruit,
     And heaven consum'd his choicest living fire!
     Let earth and heaven his timeless death deplore,
     For both their worths will equal him no more!</pre>
