Tamburlaine the Great-Part2,AMYRAS,SCENE III.,none,12,"Against the inward powers of my heart,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part2,AMYRAS,SCENE III.,none,13,"Leading a life that only strives to die,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part2,AMYRAS,SCENE III.,none,14,And plead in vain unpleasing sovereignty!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part2,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,none,1,"Let not thy love exceed thine honour, son,"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part2,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,none,5,"So, reign, my son; scourge and control those slaves,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part2,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,none,6,Guiding thy chariot with thy father's hand.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part2,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,none,7,As precious is the charge thou undertak'st

Tamburlaine the Great-Part2,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,none,17,"And draw thee  piecemeal, like Hippolytus,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part2,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,none,18,Through rocks more steep and sharp than Caspian cliffs:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part2,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,none,19,The nature of thy chariot will not bear
Tamburlaine the Great-Part2,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,none,20,"A guide of baser temper than myself,"
