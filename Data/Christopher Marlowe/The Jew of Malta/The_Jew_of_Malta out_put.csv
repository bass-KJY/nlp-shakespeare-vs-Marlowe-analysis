The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,Belike they coasted round by Candy-shore
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,About their oils or other businesses.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,But 'twas ill done of you to come so far
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,Without the aid or conduct of their ships.

The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Thus trolls our fortune in by land and sea,"

The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"These are the blessings promis'd to the Jews,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,And herein was old Abraham's happiness:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,What more may heaven do for earthly man
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,"Than thus to pour out plenty in their laps,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,7,"Ripping the bowels of the earth for them,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,8,"Making the sea their servants, and the winds"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,9,To drive their substance with successful blasts?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,10,Who hateth me but for my happiness?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,11,Or who is honour'd now but for his wealth?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,12,"Rather had I, a Jew, be hated thus,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,13,Than pitied in a Christian poverty;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,14,"For I can see no fruits in all their faith,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,15,"But malice, falsehood, and excessive pride,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,16,Which methinks fits not their profession.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,17,"Haply some hapless man hath conscience,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,18,And for his conscience lives in beggary.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,19,They say we are a scatter'd nation:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,20,I cannot tell; but we have scambled up
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,21,More wealth by far than those that brag of faith:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,22,"There's Kirriah Jairim, the great Jew of Greece,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,23,"Obed in Bairseth, Nones in Portugal,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,24,"Myself in Malta, some in Italy,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,25,"Many in France, and wealthy every one;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,26,"Ay, wealthier far than any Christian."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,27,I must confess we come not to be kings:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,28,"That's not our fault:  alas, our number's few!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,29,"And crowns come either by succession,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,30,"Or urg'd by force; and nothing violent,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,31,"Oft have I heard tell, can be permanent."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,32,"Give us a peaceful rule; make Christians kings,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,33,That thirst so much for principality.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,34,"I have no charge, nor many children,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,35,"But one sole daughter, whom I hold as dear"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,36,As Agamemnon did his Iphigen;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,37,And all I have is hers.?”But who comes here?
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"Tush, tell not me; 'twas done of policy."
The Jew of Malta,SECOND JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"Come, therefore, let us go to Barabas;"
The Jew of Malta,SECOND JEW,ACT I.,none,2,For he can counsel best in these affairs:
The Jew of Malta,SECOND JEW,ACT I.,none,3,And here he comes.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Why, how now, countrymen!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Why flock you thus to me in multitudes?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,What accident's betided to the Jews?
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"A fleet of warlike galleys, Barabas,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,2,"Are come from Turkey, and lie in our road:"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,3,And they this day sit in the council-house
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,4,To entertain them and their embassy.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Why, let 'em come, so they come not to war;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"Or let 'em war, so we be conquerors."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Nay, let 'em combat, conquer, and kill all,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"So they spare me, my daughter, and my wealth."
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"Were it for confirmation of a league,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,2,They would not come in warlike manner thus.
The Jew of Malta,SECOND JEW,ACT I.,none,1,I fear their coming will afflict us all.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Fond men, what dream you of their multitudes?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,What need they treat of peace that are in league?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,The Turks and those of Malta are in league:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"Tut, tut, there is some other matter in't."
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"Why, Barabas, they come for peace or war."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Haply for neither, but to pass along,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"Towards Venice, by the Adriatic sea,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"With whom they have attempted many times,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,But never could effect their stratagem.
The Jew of Malta,THIRD JEW,ACT I.,none,1,And very wisely said; it may be so.
The Jew of Malta,SECOND JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"But there's a meeting in the senate-house,"
The Jew of Malta,SECOND JEW,ACT I.,none,2,And all the Jews in Malta must be there.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Hum,?”all the Jews in Malta must be there!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"Ay, like enough:  why, then, let every man"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Provide him, and be there for fashion-sake."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"If any thing shall there concern our state,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,Assure yourselves I'll look?”unto myself.
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"I know you will.?”Well, brethren, let us go."
The Jew of Malta,SECOND JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"Let's take our leaves.?”Farewell, good Barabas."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"And, Barabas, now search this secret out;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"Summon thy senses, call thy wits together:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,These silly men mistake the matter clean.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,Long to the Turk did Malta contribute;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,"Which tribute all in policy, I fear,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,The Turk has  let increase to such a sum
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,7,As all the wealth of Malta cannot pay;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,8,"And now by that advantage thinks, belike,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,9,"To seize upon the town; ay, that he seeks."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,10,"Howe'er the world go, I'll make sure for one,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,11,"And seek in time to intercept the worst,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,12,Warily guarding that which I ha' got:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,13,Ego mihimet sum semper proximus:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,14,"Why, let 'em enter, let 'em take the town."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"Now, bassoes,  what demand you at our hands?"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST BASSO,ACT I.,none,1,"Know, knights of Malta, that we came from Rhodes,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST BASSO,ACT I.,none,2,"]From Cyprus, Candy, and those other isles"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST BASSO,ACT I.,none,3,That lie betwixt the Mediterranean seas.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"What's Cyprus, Candy, and those other isles"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,To us or Malta? what at our hands demand ye?
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,1,The ten years' tribute that remains unpaid.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"Alas, my lord, the sum is over-great!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,I hope your highness will consider us.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,1,"I wish, grave governor,  'twere in my power"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,2,"To favour you; but 'tis my father's cause,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,3,"Wherein I may not, nay, I dare not dally."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"Then give us leave, great Selim Calymath."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,1,"Stand all aside,  and let the knights determine;"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,2,"And send to keep our galleys under sail,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,3,For happily  we shall not tarry here.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,4,"Now, governor, how are you resolv'd?"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,Thus; since your hard conditions are such
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,"That you will needs have ten years' tribute past,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,3,We may have time to make collection
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,4,Amongst the inhabitants of Malta for't.
The Jew of Malta,FIRST BASSO,ACT I.,none,1,That's more than is in our commission.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,1,"What, Callapine! a little courtesy:"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,2,Let's know their time; perhaps it is not long;
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,3,And 'tis more kingly to obtain by peace
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,4,Than to enforce conditions by constraint.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,5,"What respite ask you, governor?"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,But a month.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,1,We grant a month; but see you keep your promise.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,2,"Now launch our galleys back again to sea,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,3,"Where we'll attend the respite you have ta'en,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,4,And for the money send our messenger.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT I.,none,5,"Farewell, great governor, and brave knights of Malta."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,And all good fortune wait on Calymath!
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,Go one and call those Jews of Malta hither:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,3,Were they not summon'd to appear to-day?
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT I.,none,1,"They were, my lord; and here they come."
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,1,Have you determin'd what to say to them?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"Yes; give me leave:?”and, Hebrews, now come near."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,]From the Emperor of Turkey is arriv'd
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,3,"Great Selim Calymath, his highness' son,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,4,To levy of us ten years' tribute past:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,5,"Now, then, here know that it concerneth us."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Then, good my lord, to keep your quiet still,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Your lordship shall do well to let them have it.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"Soft, Barabas! there's more 'longs to't than so."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,"To what this ten years' tribute will amount,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,3,"That we have cast, but cannot compass it"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,4,"By reason of the wars, that robb'd our store;"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,5,And therefore are we to request your aid.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Alas, my lord, we are no soldiers!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,And what's our aid against so great a prince?
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,1,"Tut, Jew, we know thou art no soldier:"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,2,"Thou art a merchant and a money'd man,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,3,"And 'tis thy money, Barabas, we seek."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"How, my lord! my money!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,Thine and the rest;
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,"For, to be short, amongst you't must be had."
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"Alas, my lord, the most of us are poor!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,Then let the rich increase your portions.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,Are strangers with your tribute to be tax'd?
The Jew of Malta,SECOND KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,1,Have strangers leave with us to get their wealth?
The Jew of Malta,SECOND KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,2,Then let them with us contribute.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,How! equally?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"No, Jew, like infidels;"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,"For through our sufferance of your hateful lives,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,3,"Who stand accursed in the sight of heaven,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,4,"These taxes and afflictions are befall'n,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,5,And therefore thus we are determined.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,6,Read there the articles of our decrees.
The Jew of Malta,OFFICER,ACT I.,none,1,"FIRST, THE TRIBUTE-MONEY OF THE TURKS"
The Jew of Malta,OFFICER,ACT I.,none,2,"SHALL ALL BE LEVIED AMONGST THE JEWS, AND EACH OF THEM TO PAY"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,How! half his estate!?”I hope you mean not mine.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,Read on.
The Jew of Malta,OFFICER,ACT I.,none,1,"SECONDLY, HE THAT DENIES  TO PAY, SHALL"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"How! a Christian!?”Hum,?”what's here to do?"
The Jew of Malta,OFFICER,ACT I.,none,1,"LASTLY, HE THAT DENIES THIS, SHALL ABSOLUTELY"
The Jew of Malta,THREE JEWS,ACT I.,none,1,"O my lord, we will give half!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"O earth-mettled villains, and no Hebrews born!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,And will you basely thus submit yourselves
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,To leave your goods to their arbitrement?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"Why, Barabas, wilt thou be christened?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"No, governor, I will be no convertite."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,Then pay thy half.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Why, know you what you did by this device?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Half of my substance is a city's wealth.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Governor, it was not got so easily;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,Nor will I part so slightly therewithal.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"Sir, half is the penalty of our decree;"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,"Either pay that, or we will seize on all."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,Corpo di Dio! stay:  you shall have half;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Let me be us'd but as my brethren are.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"No, Jew, thou hast denied the articles,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,And now it cannot be recall'd.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Will you, then, steal my goods?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Is theft the ground of your religion?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"No, Jew; we take particularly thine,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,To save the ruin of a multitude:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,3,"And better one want for a common good,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,4,Than many perish for a private man:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,5,"Yet, Barabas, we will not banish thee,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,6,"But here in Malta, where thou gott'st thy wealth,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,7,"Live still; and, if thou canst, get more."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Christians, what or how can I multiply?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Of naught is nothing made.
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,1,"From naught at first thou cam'st to little wealth,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,2,"]From little unto more, from more to most:"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,3,"If your first curse fall heavy on thy head,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,4,"And make thee poor and scorn'd of all the world,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,5,"'Tis not our fault, but thy inherent sin."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"What, bring you Scripture to confirm your wrongs?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Preach me not out of my possessions.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Some Jews are wicked, as all Christians are:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,But say the tribe that I descended of
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,"Were all in general cast away for sin,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,Shall I be tried by their transgression?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,7,The man that dealeth righteously shall live;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,8,And which of you can charge me otherwise?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"Out, wretched Barabas!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,"Sham'st thou not thus to justify thyself,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,3,As if we knew not thy profession?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,4,"If thou rely upon thy righteousness,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,5,"Be patient, and thy riches will increase."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,6,Excess of wealth is cause of covetousness;
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,7,"And covetousness, O, 'tis a monstrous sin!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Ay, but theft is worse:  tush! take not from me, then,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"For that is theft; and, if you rob me thus,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"I must be forc'd to steal, and compass more."
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,1,"Grave governor, list not to his exclaims:"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,2,Convert his mansion to a nunnery;
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,3,His house will harbour many holy nuns.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,It shall be so.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,"Now, officers, have you done?"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT I.,none,1,"Ay, my lord, we have seiz'd upon the goods"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT I.,none,2,"And wares of Barabas, which, being valu'd,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT I.,none,3,Amount to more than all the wealth in Malta:
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT I.,none,4,And of the other we have seized half.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,Then we'll take  order for the residue.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"You have my goods, my money, and my wealth,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"My ships, my store, and all that I enjoy'd;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"And, having all, you can request no more,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,Unless your unrelenting flinty hearts
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,"Suppress all pity in your stony breasts,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,7,And now shall move you to bereave my life.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"No, Barabas; to stain our hands with blood"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,Is far from us and our profession.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Why, I esteem the injury far less,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,To take the lives of miserable men
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,Than be the causers of their misery.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"You have my wealth, the labour of my life,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,"The comfort of mine age, my children's hope;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,And therefore ne'er distinguish of the wrong.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"Content thee, Barabas; thou hast naught but right."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,Your extreme right does me exceeding wrong:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"But take it to you, i'the devil's name!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,1,"Come, let us in, and gather of these goods"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT I.,none,2,The money for this tribute of the Turk.
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,1,'Tis necessary that be look'd unto;
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,2,"For, if we break our day, we break the league,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT I.,none,3,And that will prove but simple policy.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Ay, policy! that's their profession,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"And not simplicity, as they suggest."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"The plagues of Egypt, and the curse of heaven,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"Earth's barrenness, and all men's hatred,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,"Inflict upon them, thou great Primus Motor!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,"And here upon my knees, striking the earth,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,7,"I ban their souls to everlasting pains,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,8,"And extreme tortures of the fiery deep,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,9,That thus have dealt with me in my distress!
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"O, yet be patient, gentle Barabas!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"O silly brethren, born to see this day,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Why stand you thus unmov'd with my laments?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,Why weep you not to think upon my wrongs?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"Why pine not I, and die in this distress?"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"Why, Barabas, as hardly can we brook"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,2,The cruel handling of ourselves in this:
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,3,Thou seest they have taken half our goods.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,Why did you yield to their extortion?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"You were a multitude, and I but one;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,And of me only have they taken all.
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"Yet, brother Barabas, remember Job."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,What tell you me of Job? I wot his wealth
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"Was written thus; he had seven thousand sheep,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Three thousand camels, and two hundred yoke"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"Of labouring oxen, and five hundred"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,"She-asses:  but for every one of those,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,"Had they been valu'd at indifferent rate,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,7,"I had at home, and in mine argosy,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,8,"And other ships that came from Egypt last,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,9,"As much as would have bought his beasts and him,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,10,And yet have kept enough to live upon;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,11,"So that not he, but I, may curse the day,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,12,"Thy fatal birth-day, forlorn Barabas;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,13,"And henceforth wish for an eternal night,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,14,"That clouds of darkness may inclose my flesh,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,15,And hide these extreme sorrows from mine eyes;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,16,For only I have toil'd to inherit here
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,17,"The months of vanity, and loss of time,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,18,"And painful nights, have been appointed me."
The Jew of Malta,SECOND JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"Good Barabas, be patient."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Ay, I pray, leave me in my patience.  You, that"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"Were ne'er possess'd of wealth, are pleas'd with want;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"But give him liberty at least to mourn,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"That in a field, amidst his enemies,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,"Doth see his soldiers slain, himself disarm'd,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,And knows no means of his recovery:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,7,"Ay, let me sorrow for this sudden chance;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,8,'Tis in the trouble of my spirit I speak:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,9,Great injuries are not so soon forgot.
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"Come, let us leave him; in his ireful mood"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST JEW,ACT I.,none,2,Our words will but increase his ecstasy.
The Jew of Malta,SECOND JEW,ACT I.,none,1,"On, then:  but, trust me, 'tis a misery"
The Jew of Malta,SECOND JEW,ACT I.,none,2,To see a man in such affliction.
The Jew of Malta,SECOND JEW,ACT I.,none,3,"Farewell, Barabas."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Ay, fare you well."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"See the simplicity of these base slaves,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Who, for the villains have no wit themselves,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"Think me to be a senseless lump of clay,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,That will with every water wash to dirt!
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,"No, Barabas is born to better chance,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,7,"And fram'd of finer mould than common men,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,8,That measure naught but by the present time.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,9,"A reaching thought will search his deepest wits,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,10,And cast with cunning for the time to come;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,11,For evils are apt to happen every day.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,12,But whither wends my beauteous Abigail?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,13,"O, what has made my lovely daughter sad?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,14,"What, woman! moan not for a little loss;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,15,Thy father has enough in store for thee.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,"Nor for myself, but aged Barabas,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,2,"Father, for thee lamenteth Abigail:"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,3,But I will learn to leave these fruitless tears;
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,4,"And, urg'd thereto with my afflictions,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,5,"With fierce exclaims run to the senate-house,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,6,"And in the senate reprehend them all,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,7,"And rent their hearts with tearing of my hair,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,8,Till they reduce  the wrongs done to my father.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"No, Abigail; things past recovery"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Are hardly cur'd with exclamations:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Be silent, daughter; sufferance breeds ease,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"And time may yield us an occasion,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,Which on the sudden cannot serve the turn.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,"Besides, my girl, think me not all so fond"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,7,As negligently to forgo so much
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,8,Without provision for thyself and me:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,9,"Ten thousand portagues,  besides great pearls,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,10,"Rich costly jewels, and stones infinite,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,11,"Fearing the worst of this before it fell,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,12,I closely hid.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,"Where, father?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"In my house, my girl."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,Then shall they ne'er be seen of Barabas;
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,2,For they have seiz'd upon thy house and wares.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"But they will give me leave once more, I trow,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,To go into my house.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,That may they not;
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,2,"For there I left the governor placing nuns,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,3,Displacing me; and of thy house they mean
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,4,"To make a nunnery, where none but their own sect"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,5,Must enter in; men generally barr'd.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"My gold, my gold, and all my wealth is gone!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"You partial heavens, have I deserv'd this plague?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"What, will you thus oppose me, luckless stars,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,To make me desperate in my poverty?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,"And, knowing me impatient in distress,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,"Think me so mad as I will hang myself,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,7,"That I may vanish o'er the earth in air,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,8,And leave no memory that e'er I was?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,9,"No, I will live; nor loathe I this my life:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,10,"And, since you leave me in the ocean thus"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,11,"To sink or swim, and put me to my shifts,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,12,"I'll rouse my senses, and awake myself."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,13,"Daughter, I have it:  thou perceiv'st the plight"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,14,Wherein these Christians have oppressed me:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,15,"Be rul'd by me, for in extremity"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,16,We ought to make bar of no policy.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,"Father, whate'er it be, to injure them"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,2,"That have so manifestly wronged us,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,3,What will not Abigail attempt?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Why, so."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Then thus:  thou told'st me they have turn'd my house
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Into a nunnery, and some nuns are there?"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,I did.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Then, Abigail, there must my girl"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Entreat the abbess to be entertain'd.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,How! as a nun?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Ay, daughter; for religion"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,Hides many mischiefs from suspicion.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,"Ay, but, father, they will suspect me there."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,Let 'em suspect; but be thou so precise
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,As they may think it done of holiness:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Entreat 'em fair, and give them friendly speech,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"And seem to them as if thy sins were great,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,Till thou hast gotten to be entertain'd.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,"Thus, father, shall I much dissemble."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,Tush!
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"As good dissemble that thou never mean'st,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,As first mean truth and then dissemble it:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,A counterfeit profession is better
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,Than unseen hypocrisy.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,"Well, father, say I be entertain'd,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,2,What then shall follow?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,This shall follow then.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,"There have I hid, close underneath the plank"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,"That runs along the upper-chamber floor,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,The gold and jewels which I kept for thee:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,"But here they come:  be cunning, Abigail."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,"Then, father, go with me."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"No, Abigail, in this"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,It is not necessary I be seen;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,For I will seem offended with thee for't:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"Be close, my girl, for this must fetch my gold."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,1,"Sisters,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,2,We now are almost at the new-made nunnery.
The Jew of Malta,ABBESS,ACT I.,none,1,The better; for we love not to be seen:
The Jew of Malta,ABBESS,ACT I.,none,2,'Tis thirty winters long since some of us
The Jew of Malta,ABBESS,ACT I.,none,3,Did stray so far amongst the multitude.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,1,"But, madam, this house"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,2,And waters of this new-made nunnery
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,3,Will much delight you.
The Jew of Malta,ABBESS,ACT I.,none,1,It may be so.?”But who comes here?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,"Grave abbess, and you happy virgins' guide,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,2,Pity the state of a distressed maid!
The Jew of Malta,ABBESS,ACT I.,none,1,"What art thou, daughter?"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,"The hopeless daughter of a hapless Jew,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,2,"The Jew of Malta, wretched Barabas,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,3,"Sometimes  the owner of a goodly house,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,4,Which they have now turn'd to a nunnery.
The Jew of Malta,ABBESS,ACT I.,none,1,"Well, daughter, say, what is thy suit with us?"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,Fearing the afflictions which my father feels
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,2,"Proceed from sin or want of faith in us,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,3,"I'd pass away my life in penitence,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,4,"And be a novice in your nunnery,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,5,To make atonement for my labouring soul.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,1,"No doubt, brother, but this proceedeth of"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,2,the spirit.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT I.,none,1,"Ay, and of a moving spirit too, brother:  but come,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT I.,none,2,Let us entreat she may be entertain'd.
The Jew of Malta,ABBESS,ACT I.,none,1,"Well, daughter, we admit you for a nun."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,First let me as a novice learn to frame
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,2,"My solitary life to your strait laws,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,3,And let me lodge where I was wont to lie:
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,4,"I do not doubt, by your divine precepts"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,5,"And mine own industry, but to profit much."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"As much, I hope, as all I hid is worth."
The Jew of Malta,ABBESS,ACT I.,none,1,"Come, daughter, follow us."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Why, how now, Abigail!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,What mak'st thou 'mongst these hateful Christians?
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,1,"Hinder her not, thou man of little faith,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,2,For she has mortified herself.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,How! mortified!
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,1,And is admitted to the sisterhood.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Child of perdition, and thy father's shame!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,What wilt thou do among these hateful fiends?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,I charge thee on my blessing that thou leave
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,These devils and their damned heresy!
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT I.,none,1,"Father, forgive me"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Nay, back, Abigail,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,And think upon the jewels and the gold;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,The board is marked thus that covers it.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"Away, accursed, from thy father's sight!"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,1,"Barabas, although thou art in misbelief,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,2,"And wilt not see thine own afflictions,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT I.,none,3,Yet let thy daughter be no longer blind.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Blind friar, I reck not thy persuasions,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,2,The board is marked thus  that covers it
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,3,For I had rather die than see her thus.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,4,"Wilt thou forsake me too in my distress,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,5,"Seduced daughter??”Go, forget not."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,6,Becomes it Jews to be so credulous?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,7,To-morrow early I'll be at the door.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,8,"No, come not at me; if thou wilt be damn'd,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,9,"Forget me, see me not; and so, be gone!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,10,Farewell; remember to-morrow morning.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT I.,none,11,"Out, out, thou wretch!"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Who's this? fair Abigail, the rich Jew's daughter,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,2,Become a nun! her father's sudden fall
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Has humbled her, and brought her down to this:"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,4,"Tut, she were fitter for a tale of love,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,5,Than to be tired out with orisons;
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,6,"And better would she far become a bed,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,7,"Embraced in a friendly lover's arms,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,8,Than rise at midnight to a solemn mass.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT I.,none,1,"Why, how now, Don Mathias! in a dump?"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Believe me, noble Lodowick, I have seen"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,2,"The strangest sight, in my opinion,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,3,That ever I beheld.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT I.,none,1,"What was't, I prithee?"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,1,"A fair young maid, scarce fourteen years of age,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,2,"The sweetest flower in Cytherea's field,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Cropt from the pleasures of the fruitful earth,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,4,And strangely metamorphos'd  nun.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT I.,none,1,"But say, what was she?"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Why, the rich Jew's daughter."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT I.,none,1,"What, Barabas, whose goods were lately seiz'd?"
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT I.,none,2,Is she so fair?
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,1,"And matchless beautiful,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,2,"As, had you seen her, 'twould have mov'd your heart,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,3,"Though countermin'd with walls of brass, to love,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,4,"Or, at the least, to pity."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT I.,none,1,"An if she be so fair as you report,"
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT I.,none,2,'Twere time well spent to go and visit her:
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT I.,none,3,How say you? shall we?
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,1,"I must and will, sir; there's no remedy."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT I.,none,1,"And so will I too, or it shall go hard."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT I.,none,2,"Farewell, Mathias."
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT I.,none,1,"Farewell, Lodowick."
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,2,"Farewell, Lodowick."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Thus, like the sad-presaging raven, that tolls"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"The sick man's passport in her hollow beak,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,And in the shadow of the silent night
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"Doth shake contagion from her sable wings,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,Vex'd and tormented runs poor Barabas
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,With fatal curses towards these Christians.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,The incertain pleasures of swift-footed time
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,8,"Have ta'en their flight, and left me in despair;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,9,And of my former riches rests no more
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,10,"But bare remembrance; like a soldier's scar,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,11,That has no further comfort for his maim.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,12,"O Thou, that with a fiery pillar ledd'st"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,13,"The sons of Israel through the dismal shades,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,14,Light Abraham's offspring; and direct the hand
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,15,Of Abigail this night! or let the day
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,16,Turn to eternal darkness after this!
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,17,"No sleep can fasten on my watchful eyes,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,18,"Nor quiet enter my distemper'd thoughts,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,19,Till I have answer of my Abigail.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,Now have I happily espied a time
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,2,To search the plank my father did appoint;
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,3,"And here, behold, unseen, where I have found"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,4,"The gold, the pearls, and jewels, which he hid."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Now I remember those old women's words,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"Who in my wealth would tell me winter's tales,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,And speak of spirits and ghosts that glide by night
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,About the place where treasure hath been hid:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,And now methinks that I am one of those;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,"For, whilst I live, here lives my soul's sole hope,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,"And, when I die, here shall my spirit walk."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,Now that my father's fortune were so good
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,2,As but to be about this happy place!
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,3,"'Tis not so happy:  yet, when we parted last,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,4,He said he would attend me in the morn.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,5,"Then, gentle Sleep, where'er his body rests,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,6,Give charge to Morpheus that he may dream
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,7,"A golden dream, and of  the sudden wake,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,8,Come and receive the treasure I have found.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,Bueno para todos mi ganado no era:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"As good go on, as sit so sadly thus."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,But stay:  what star shines yonder in the east?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"The loadstar of my life, if Abigail."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,Who's there?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,Who's that?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Peace, Abigail! 'tis I."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,"Then, father, here receive thy happiness."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,Hast thou't?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,Here.  Hast thou't?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,2,"There's more, and more, and more."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"O my girl,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"My gold, my fortune, my felicity,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"Strength to my soul, death to mine enemy;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,Welcome the first beginner of my bliss!
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,"O Abigail, Abigail, that I had thee here too!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,Then my desires were fully satisfied:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,But I will practice thy enlargement thence:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,8,O girl! O gold! O beauty! O my bliss!
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,"Father, it draweth towards midnight now,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,2,And 'bout this time the nuns begin to wake;
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,3,"To shun suspicion, therefore, let us part."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Farewell, my joy, and by my fingers take"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,A kiss from him that sends it from his soul.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"Now, Phoebus, ope the eye-lids of the day."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"And, for the raven, wake the morning lark,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,"That I may hover with her in the air,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,"Singing o'er these, as she does o'er her young."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,Hermoso placer de los dineros.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,1,"Now, captain, tell us whither thou art bound?"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,2,Whence is thy ship that anchors in our road?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,3,And why thou cam'st ashore without our leave?
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,1,"Governor of Malta, hither am I bound;"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,2,"My ship, the Flying Dragon, is of Spain,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,3,"And so am I; Del Bosco is my name,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,4,Vice-admiral unto the Catholic King.
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT II.,none,1,"'Tis true, my lord; therefore entreat him well."
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,1,"Our fraught is Grecians, Turks, and Afric Moors;"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,2,"For late upon the coast of Corsica,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,3,"Because we vail'd not  to the Turkish  fleet,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,4,Their creeping galleys had us in the chase:
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,5,"But suddenly the wind began to rise,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,6,"And then we luff'd and tack'd,  and fought at ease:"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,7,"Some have we fir'd, and many have we sunk;"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,8,But one amongst the rest became our prize:
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,9,"The captain's slain; the rest remain our slaves,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,10,Of whom we would make sale in Malta here.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,1,"Martin del Bosco, I have heard of thee:"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,2,"Welcome to Malta, and to all of us!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,3,"But to admit a sale of these thy Turks,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,4,"We may not, nay, we dare not give consent,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,5,By reason of a tributary league.
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT II.,none,1,"Del Bosco, as thou lov'st and honour'st us,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT II.,none,2,Persuade our governor against the Turk:
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT II.,none,3,"This truce we have is but in hope of gold,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT II.,none,4,And with that sum he craves might we wage war.
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,1,"Will knights of Malta be in league with Turks,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,2,And buy it basely too for sums of gold?
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,3,"My lord, remember that, to Europe's shame,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,4,"The Christian isle of Rhodes, from whence you came,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,5,"Was lately lost, and you were stated  here"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,6,To be at deadly enmity with Turks.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,1,"Captain, we know it; but our force is small."
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,1,What is the sum that Calymath requires?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,1,A hundred thousand crowns.
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,1,"My lord and king hath title to this isle,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,2,And he means quickly to expel you hence;
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,3,"Therefore be rul'd by me, and keep the gold:"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,4,"I'll write unto his majesty for aid,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,5,And not depart until I see you free.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,1,On this condition shall thy Turks be sold.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,2,"Go, officers, and set them straight in show."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,3,"Bosco, thou shalt be Malta's general;"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,4,We and our warlike knights will follow thee
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,5,Against these barbarous misbelieving Turks.
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,1,So shall you imitate those you succeed;
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,2,"For, when their hideous force environ'd Rhodes,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,3,"Small though the number was that kept the town,"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,4,"They fought it out, and not a man surviv'd"
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT II.,none,5,To bring the hapless news to Christendom.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,1,"So will we fight it out:  come, let's away."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,2,"Proud daring Calymath, instead of gold,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,3,We'll send thee bullets wrapt in smoke and fire:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,4,"Claim tribute where thou wilt, we are resolv'd,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT II.,none,5,"Honour is bought with blood, and not with gold."
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT II.,none,1,This is the market-place; here let 'em stand:
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT II.,none,2,"Fear not their sale, for they'll be quickly bought."
The Jew of Malta,SECOND OFFICER,ACT II.,none,1,"Every one's price is written on his back,"
The Jew of Malta,SECOND OFFICER,ACT II.,none,2,"And so much must they yield, or not be sold."
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT II.,none,1,"Here comes the Jew:  had not his goods been seiz'd,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT II.,none,2,He'd give us present money for them all.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"In spite of these swine-eating Christians,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"(Unchosen nation, never circumcis'd,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"Poor villains, such as were  ne'er thought upon"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"Till Titus and Vespasian conquer'd us,)"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,Am I become as wealthy as I was.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,They hop'd my daughter would ha' been a nun;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,"But she's at home, and I have bought a house"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,8,As great and fair as is the governor's:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,9,"And there, in spite of Malta, will I dwell,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,10,"Having Ferneze's hand; whose heart I'll have,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,11,"Ay, and his son's too, or it shall go hard."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,12,"I am not of the tribe of Levi, I,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,13,That can so soon forget an injury.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,14,We Jews can fawn like spaniels when we please;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,15,And when we grin we bite; yet are our looks
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,16,As innocent and harmless as a lamb's.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,17,"I learn'd in Florence how to kiss my hand,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,18,"Heave up my shoulders when they call me dog,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,19,And duck as low as any bare-foot friar;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,20,"Hoping to see them starve upon a stall,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,21,"Or else be gather'd for in our synagogue,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,22,"That, when the offering-basin comes to me,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,23,Even for charity I may spit into't.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,24,"Here comes Don Lodowick, the governor's son,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,25,One that I love for his good father's sake.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,I hear the wealthy Jew walked this way:
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,2,"I'll seek him out, and so insinuate,"
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,3,"That I may have a sight of Abigail,"
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,4,For Don Mathias tells me she is fair.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,Now will I shew myself to have more of the serpent than
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"the dove; that is, more knave than fool."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,Yond' walks the Jew:  now for fair Abigail.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Ay, ay, no doubt but she's at your command."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"Barabas, thou know'st I am the governor's son."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"I would you were his father too, sir! that's all the harm"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,I wish you.?”The slave looks like a hog's cheek new-singed.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"Whither walk'st thou, Barabas?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"No further:  'tis a custom held with us,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"That when we speak with Gentiles like to you,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,We turn into  the air to purge ourselves;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,For unto us the promise doth belong.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"Well, Barabas, canst help me to a diamond?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"O, sir, your father had my diamonds:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,Yet I have one left that will serve your turn.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"I mean my daughter; but, ere he shall have her,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,I'll sacrifice her on a pile of wood:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,"I ha' the poison of the city  for him,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,And the white leprosy.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,What sparkle does it give without a foil?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,The diamond that I talk of ne'er was foil'd:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"But, when he touches it, it will be foil'd."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"Lord Lodowick, it sparkles bright and fair."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"Is it square or pointed? pray, let me know."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Pointed it is, good sir,?”but not for you."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,I like it much the better.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,So do I too.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,How shews it by night?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,Outshines Cynthia's rays:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,You'll like it better far o' nights than days.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,And what's the price?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Your life, an if you have it .?”O my lord,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"We will not jar about the price:  come to my house,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,And I will give't your honour?”with a vengeance.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"No, Barabas, I will deserve it first."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Good sir,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"Your father has deserv'd it at my hands,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"Who, of mere charity and Christian ruth,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"To bring me to religious purity,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,"And, as it were, in catechising sort,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,"To make me mindful of my mortal sins,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,"Against my will, and whether I would or no,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,8,"Seiz'd all I had, and thrust me out o' doors,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,9,And made my house a place for nuns most chaste.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,No doubt your soul shall reap the fruit of it.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Ay, but, my lord, the harvest is far off:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,And yet I know the prayers of those nuns
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"And holy friars, having money for their pains,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,Are wondrous;?”and indeed do no man good;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,"And, seeing they are not idle, but still doing,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,"'Tis likely they in time may reap some fruit,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,"I mean, in fullness of perfection."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"Good Barabas, glance not at our holy nuns."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"No, but I do it through a burning zeal,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,Hoping ere long to set the house a-fire;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"For, though they do a while increase and multiply,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,I'll have a saying to that nunnery.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,"As for the diamond, sir, I told you of,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,"Come home, and there's no price shall make us part,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,"Even for your honourable father's sake,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,8,It shall go hard but I will see your death.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,9,But now I must be gone to buy a slave.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"And, Barabas, I'll bear thee company."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Come, then; here's the market-place."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,What's the price of this slave? two hundred crowns! do the Turks
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,weigh so much?
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT II.,none,1,"Sir, that's his price."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"What, can he steal, that you demand so much?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,Belike he has some new trick for a purse;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"An if he has, he is worth three hundred plates,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"So that, being bought, the town-seal might be got"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,To keep him for his life-time from the gallows:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,"The sessions-day is critical to thieves,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,And few or none scape but by being purg'd.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,Rat'st thou this Moor but at two hundred plates?
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT II.,none,1,"No more, my lord."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,Why should this Turk be dearer than that Moor?
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT II.,none,1,"Because he is young, and has more qualities."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"What, hast the philosopher's stone? an thou hast, break"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"my head with it, I'll forgive thee."
The Jew of Malta,SLAVE,ACT II.,none,1,"No, sir; I can cut and shave."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Let me see, sirrah; are you not an old shaver?"
The Jew of Malta,SLAVE,ACT II.,none,1,"Alas, sir, I am a very youth!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"A youth! I'll buy you, and marry you to Lady Vanity,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,if you do well.
The Jew of Malta,SLAVE,ACT II.,none,1,"I will serve you, sir."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Some wicked trick or other:  it may be, under colour"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"of shaving, thou'lt cut my throat for my goods.  Tell me,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,hast thou thy health well?
The Jew of Malta,SLAVE,ACT II.,none,1,"Ay, passing well."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"So much the worse:  I must have one that's sickly, an't"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,be but for sparing victuals:  'tis not a stone of beef a-day
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,will maintain you in these chops.?”Let me see one that's
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,somewhat leaner.
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT II.,none,1,Here's a leaner; how like you him?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,Where wast thou born?
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,1,In Thrace; brought up in Arabia.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,So much the better; thou art for my turn.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,An hundred crowns?  I'll have him; there's the coin.
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT II.,none,1,"Then mark him, sir, and take him hence."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Ay, mark him, you were best; for this is he"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,That by my help shall do much villany.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"My lord, farewell.?”Come, sirrah; you are mine."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"As for the diamond, it shall be yours:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,"I pray, sir, be no stranger at my house;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,All that I have shall be at your command.
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,What make the Jew and Lodowick so private?
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,2,I fear me 'tis about fair Abigail.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,Yonder comes Don Mathias; let us stay:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"He loves my daughter, and she holds him dear;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"But I have sworn to frustrate both their hopes,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,And be reveng'd upon the?”governor.
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT II.,none,1,"This Moor is comeliest, is he not? speak, son."
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,"No, this is the better, mother, view this well."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Seem not to know me here before your mother,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,Lest she mistrust the match that is in hand:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"When you have brought her home, come to my house;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"Think of me as thy father:  son, farewell."
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,But wherefore talk'd Don Lodowick with you?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Tush, man! we talk'd of diamonds, not of Abigail."
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT II.,none,1,"Tell me, Mathias, is not that the Jew?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"As for the comment on the Maccabees,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"I have it, sir, and 'tis at your command."
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Yes, madam, and my talk with him was"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,2,About the borrowing of a book or two.
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT II.,none,1,Converse not with him; he is cast off from heaven.
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT II.,none,2,"Thou hast thy crowns, fellow.?”Come, let's away."
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Sirrah Jew, remember the book."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Marry, will I, sir."
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT II.,none,1,"Come, I have made a reasonable market; let's away."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Now let me know thy name, and therewithal"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"Thy birth, condition, and profession."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,1,"Faith, sir, my birth is but mean; my name's Ithamore;"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,2,my profession what you please.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Hast thou no trade? then listen to my words,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,And I will teach  that shall stick by thee:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"First, be thou void of these affections,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"Compassion, love, vain hope, and heartless fear;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,"Be mov'd at nothing, see thou pity none,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,But to thyself smile when the Christians moan.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,1,"O, brave, master!  I worship your nose  for this."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"As for myself, I walk abroad o' nights,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,And kill sick people groaning under walls:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,Sometimes I go about and poison wells;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"And now and then, to cherish Christian thieves,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,"I am content to lose some of my crowns,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,"That I may, walking in my gallery,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,See 'em go pinion'd along by my door.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,8,"Being young, I studied physic, and began"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,9,To practice first upon the Italian;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,10,"There I enrich'd the priests with burials,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,11,And always kept the sexton's arms in ure
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,12,With digging graves and ringing dead men's knells:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,13,"And, after that, was I an engineer,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,14,"And in the wars 'twixt France and Germany,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,15,"Under pretence of helping Charles the Fifth,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,16,Slew friend and enemy with my stratagems:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,17,"Then, after that, was I an usurer,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,18,"And with extorting, cozening, forfeiting,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,19,"And tricks belonging unto brokery,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,20,"I fill'd the gaols with bankrupts in a year,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,21,And with young orphans planted hospitals;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,22,"And every moon made some or other mad,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,23,"And now and then one hang himself for grief,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,24,Pinning upon his breast a long great scroll
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,25,How I with interest tormented him.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,26,But mark how I am blest for plaguing them;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,27,I have as much coin as will buy the town.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,28,"But tell me now, how hast thou spent thy time?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,1,"Faith, master,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,2,"In setting Christian villages on fire,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,3,"Chaining of eunuchs, binding galley-slaves."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,4,"One time I was an hostler in an inn,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,5,And in the night-time secretly would I steal
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,6,"To travellers' chambers, and there cut their throats:"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,7,"Once at Jerusalem, where the pilgrims kneel'd,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,8,"I strewed powder on the marble stones,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,9,"And therewithal their knees would rankle so,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,10,That I have laugh'd a-good  to see the cripples
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,11,Go limping home to Christendom on stilts.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Why, this is something:  make account of me"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,As of thy fellow; we are villains both;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,Both circumcised; we hate Christians both:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,Be true and secret; thou shalt want no gold.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,But stand aside; here comes Don Lodowick.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"O, Barabas, well met;"
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,2,Where is the diamond you told me of?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"I have it for you, sir:  please you walk in with me."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"What, ho, Abigail! open the door, I say!"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,"In good time, father; here are letters come"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,2,"]From Ormus, and the post stays here within."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Give me the letters.?”Daughter, do you hear?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"Entertain Lodowick, the governor's son,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"With all the courtesy you can afford,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,Provided that you keep your maidenhead:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,Use him as if he were a Philistine;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,"Dissemble, swear, protest, vow love to him:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,He is not of the seed of Abraham.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,8,"I am a little busy, sir; pray, pardon me."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,9,"Abigail, bid him welcome for my sake."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,For your sake and his own he's welcome hither.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Daughter, a word more:  kiss him, speak him fair,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"And like a cunning Jew so cast about,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,That ye be both made sure  ere you come out.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,"O father, Don Mathias is my love!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"I know it:  yet, I say, make love to him;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"Do, it is requisite it should be so."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"Nay, on my life, it is my factor's hand;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"But go you in, I'll think upon the account."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,"The account is made, for Lodovico  dies."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,My factor sends me word a merchant's fled
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,That owes me for a hundred tun of wine:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,8,I weigh it thus much!  I have wealth enough;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,9,"For now by this has he kiss'd Abigail,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,10,"And she vows love to him, and he to her."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,11,"As sure as heaven rain'd manna for the Jews,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,12,So sure shall he and Don Mathias die:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,13,His father was my chiefest enemy.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,14,Whither goes Don Mathias? stay a while.
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Whither, but to my fair love Abigail?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Thou know'st, and heaven can witness it is true,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,That I intend my daughter shall be thine.
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Ay, Barabas, or else thou wrong'st me much."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"O, heaven forbid I should have such a thought!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,Pardon me though I weep:  the governor's son
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"Will, whether I will or no, have Abigail;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"He sends her letters, bracelets, jewels, rings."
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,Does she receive them?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"She! no, Mathias, no, but sends them back;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"And, when he comes, she locks herself up fast;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"Yet through the key-hole will he talk to her,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"While she runs to the window, looking out"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,When you should come and hale him from the door.
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,O treacherous Lodowick!
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Even now, as I came home, he slipt me in,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,And I am sure he is with Abigail.
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,I'll rouse him thence.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,Not for all Malta; therefore sheathe your sword;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"If you love me, no quarrels in my house;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"But steal you in, and seem to see him not:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"I'll give him such a warning ere he goes,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,As he shall have small hopes of Abigail.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,"Away, for here they come."
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,"What, hand in hand! I cannot suffer this."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Mathias, as thou lov'st me, not a word."
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Well, let it pass; another time shall serve."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"Barabas, is not that the widow's son?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Ay, and take heed, for he hath sworn your death."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"My death! what, is the base-born peasant mad?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"No, no; but happily  he stands in fear"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"Of that which you, I think, ne'er dream upon,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"My daughter here, a paltry silly girl."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"Why, loves she Don Mathias?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,Doth she not with her smiling answer you?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,He has my heart; I smile against my will.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"Barabas, thou know'st I have lov'd thy daughter long."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"And so has she done you, even from a child."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,And now I can no longer hold my mind.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,Nor I the affection that I bear to you.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"This is thy diamond; tell me, shall I have it?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Win it, and wear it; it is yet unsoil'd."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"O, but I know your lordship would disdain"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,To marry with the daughter of a Jew:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,And yet I'll give her many a golden cross
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,With Christian posies round about the ring.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"'Tis not thy wealth, but her that I esteem;"
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,2,Yet crave I thy consent.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,And mine you have; yet let me talk to her.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"This offspring of Cain, this Jebusite,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"That never tasted of the Passover,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"Nor e'er shall see the land of Canaan,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,Nor our Messias that is yet to come;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,"This gentle maggot, Lodowick, I mean,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,7,"Must be deluded:  let him have thy hand,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,8,But keep thy heart till Don Mathias comes.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,"What, shall I be betroth'd to Lodowick?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,It's no sin to deceive a Christian;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"For they themselves hold it a principle,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,Faith is not to be held with heretics:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,But all are heretics that are not Jews;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,5,"This follows well, and therefore, daughter, fear not."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,6,"I have entreated her, and she will grant."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"Then, gentle Abigail, plight thy faith to me."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,"I cannot choose, seeing my father bids:"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,2,Nothing but death shall part my love and me.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,Now have I that for which my soul hath long'd.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,So have not I; but yet I hope I shall.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,"O wretched Abigail, what hast thou  done?"
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,Why on the sudden is your colour chang'd?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,I know not:  but farewell; I must be gone.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Stay her, but let her not speak one word more."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,Mute o' the sudden! here's a sudden change.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"O, muse not at it; 'tis the Hebrews' guise,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,That maidens new-betroth'd should weep a while:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"Trouble her not; sweet Lodowick, depart:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,"She is thy wife, and thou shalt be mine heir."
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"O, is't the custom? then I am resolv'd:"
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,2,"But rather let the brightsome heavens be dim,"
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,3,"And nature's beauty choke with stifling clouds,"
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,4,Than my fair Abigail should frown on me.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,5,There comes the villain; now I'll be reveng'd.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Be quiet, Lodowick; it is enough"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,That I have made thee sure to Abigail.
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT II.,none,1,"Well, let him go."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Well, but for me, as you went in at doors"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,You had been stabb'd:  but not a word on't now;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"Here must no speeches pass, nor swords be drawn."
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Suffer me, Barabas, but to follow him."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"No; so shall I, if any hurt be done,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,Be made an accessary of your deeds:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,Revenge it on him when you meet him next.
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,For this I'll have his heart.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Do so.  Lo, here I give thee Abigail!"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,What greater gift can poor Mathias have?
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,2,Shall Lodowick rob me of so fair a love?
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,3,My life is not so dear as Abigail.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"My heart misgives me, that, to cross your love,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,He's with your mother; therefore after him.
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,"What, is he gone unto my mother?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Nay, if you will, stay till she comes herself."
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,1,"I cannot stay; for, if my mother come,"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT II.,none,2,She'll die with grief.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,I cannot take my leave of him for tears.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,2,"Father, why have you thus incens'd them both?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,What's that to thee?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,I'll make 'em friends again.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"You'll make 'em friends! are there not Jews enow in Malta,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,But thou must dote upon a Christian?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT II.,none,1,I will have Don Mathias; he is my love.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Yes, you shall have him.?”Go, put her in."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,1,"Ay, I'll put her in."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Now tell me, Ithamore, how lik'st thou this?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,1,"Faith, master, I think by this"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,2,You purchase both their lives:  is it not so?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,True; and it shall be cunningly perform'd.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,1,"O, master, that I might have a hand in this!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Ay, so thou shalt; 'tis thou must do the deed:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"Take this, and bear it to Mathias straight,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,And tell him that it comes from Lodowick.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,1,"'Tis poison'd, is it not?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"No, no; and yet it might be done that way:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,It is a challenge feign'd from Lodowick.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,1,"Fear not; I will so set his heart a-fire,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,2,That he shall verily think it comes from him.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,I cannot choose but like thy readiness:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"Yet be not rash, but do it cunningly."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT II.,none,1,"As I behave myself in this, employ me hereafter."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,1,"Away, then!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,2,"So; now will I go in to Lodowick,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,3,"And, like a cunning spirit, feign some lie,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT II.,none,4,Till I have set 'em both at enmity.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,5,"Away, then!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,6,"So; now will I go in to Lodowick,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,7,"And, like a cunning spirit, feign some lie,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,8,Till I have set 'em both at enmity.
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,1,"Since this town was besieg'd, my gain grows cold:"
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,2,"The time has been, that but for one bare night"
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,3,A hundred ducats have been freely given;
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,4,But now against my will I must be chaste:
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,5,And yet I know my beauty doth not fail.
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,6,"]From Venice merchants, and from Padua"
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,7,"Were wont to come rare-witted gentlemen,"
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,8,"Scholars I mean, learned and liberal;"
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,9,"And now, save Pilia-Borza, comes there none,"
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,10,And he is very seldom from my house;
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,11,And here he comes.
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT III.,none,1,"Hold thee, wench, there's something for thee to spend."
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,1,'Tis silver; I disdain it.
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT III.,none,1,"Ay, but the Jew has gold,"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT III.,none,2,"And I will have it, or it shall go hard."
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,1,"Tell me, how cam'st thou by this?"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT III.,none,1,"Faith, walking the back-lanes, through the gardens,"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT III.,none,2,"I chanced to cast mine eye up to the Jew's counting-house, where"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT III.,none,3,"I saw some bags of money, and in the night I clambered up with"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT III.,none,4,"my hooks; and, as I was taking my choice, I heard a rumbling in"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT III.,none,5,"the house; so I took only this, and run my way.?”But here's the"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT III.,none,6,Jew's man.
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT III.,none,1,Hide the bag.
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT III.,none,1,"Look not towards him, let's away.  Zoons, what a"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT III.,none,2,looking thou keepest! thou'lt betray's anon.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"O, the sweetest face that ever I beheld!  I know she"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,is a courtezan by her attire:  now would I give a hundred of
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,3,the Jew's crowns that I had such a concubine.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,4,"Well, I have deliver'd the challenge in such sort,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,5,"As meet they will, and fighting die,?”brave sport!"
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT III.,none,1,This is the place:   now Abigail shall see
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT III.,none,2,Whether Mathias holds her dear or no.
The Jew of Malta,MATHIAS,ACT III.,none,3,"What, dares the villain write in such base terms?"
The Jew of Malta,LODOWICK,ACT III.,none,1,"I did it; and revenge it, if thou dar'st!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"O, bravely fought! and yet they thrust not home."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,"Now, Lodovico!  now, Mathias!?”So;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,"So, now they have shew'd themselves to be tall  fellows."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,4,"Part 'em, part 'em!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,5,"Ay, part 'em now they are dead.  Farewell, farewell!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,What sight is this!  my Lodovico  slain!
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,2,These arms of mine shall be thy sepulchre.
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT III.,none,1,Who is this? my son Mathias slain!
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,"O Lodowick, hadst thou perish'd by the Turk,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,2,Wretched Ferneze might have veng'd thy death!
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT III.,none,1,"Thy son slew mine, and I'll revenge his death."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,"Look, Katharine, look! thy son gave mine these wounds."
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT III.,none,1,"O, leave to grieve me!  I am griev'd enough."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,"O, that my sighs could turn to lively breath,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,2,"And these my tears to blood, that he might live!"
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT III.,none,1,Who made them enemies?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,I know not; and that grieves me most of all.
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT III.,none,1,My son lov'd thine.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,And so did Lodowick him.
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT III.,none,1,"Lend me that weapon that did kill my son,"
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT III.,none,2,And it shall murder me.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,"Nay, madam, stay; that weapon was my son's,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,2,And on that rather should Ferneze die.
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT III.,none,1,"Hold; let's inquire the causers of their deaths,"
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT III.,none,2,That we may venge their blood upon their heads.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,"Then take them up, and let them be interr'd"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,2,Within one sacred monument of stone;
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,3,Upon which altar I will offer up
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,4,"My daily sacrifice of sighs and tears,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,5,"And with my prayers pierce impartial heavens,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,6,"Till they  the causers of our smarts,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,7,Which forc'd their hands divide united hearts.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,8,"Come, Katharine; our losses equal are;"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,9,Then of true grief let us take equal share.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"Why, was there ever seen such villany,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,"So neatly plotted, and so well perform'd?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,3,"Both held in hand,  and flatly both beguil'd?"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"Why, how now, Ithamore! why laugh'st thou so?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"O mistress! ha, ha, ha!"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"Why, what ail'st thou?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"O, my master!"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,Ha!
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"O mistress, I have the bravest, gravest, secret,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,"subtle, bottle-nosed  knave to my master, that ever gentleman had!"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"Say, knave, why rail'st upon my father thus?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"O, my master has the bravest policy!"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,Wherein?
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"Why, know you not?"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"Why, no."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,Know you not of Mathia and Don Lodowick disaster?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,No:  what was it?
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"Why, the devil inverted a challenge, my master"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,"writ it, and I carried it, first to Lodowick, and imprimis to Mathia;"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,3,"And then they met, , as the story says,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,4,In doleful wise they ended both their days.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,And was my father furtherer of their deaths?
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,Am I Ithamore?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,Yes.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"So sure did your father write, and I carry the challenge."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"Well, Ithamore, let me request thee this;"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,"Go to the new-made nunnery, and inquire"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,3,"For any of the friars of Saint Jaques,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,4,"And say, I pray them come and speak with me."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"I pray, mistress, will you answer me to one question?"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"Well, sirrah, what is't?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,A very feeling one:  have not the nuns fine sport with
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,the friars now and then?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"Go to, Sirrah Sauce! is this your question? get ye gone."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"I will, forsooth, mistress."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"Hard-hearted father, unkind Barabas!"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,"Was this the pursuit of thy policy,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,3,"To make me shew them favour severally,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,4,That by my favour they should both be slain?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,5,"Admit thou lov'dst not Lodowick for his sire,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,6,Yet Don Mathias ne'er offended thee:
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,7,"But thou wert set upon extreme revenge,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,8,"Because the prior dispossess'd thee once,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,9,And couldst not venge it but upon his son;
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,10,Nor on his son but by Mathias' means;
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,11,Nor on Mathias but by murdering me:
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,12,"But I perceive there is no love on earth,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,13,"Pity in Jews, nor piety in Turks."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,14,But here comes cursed Ithamore with the friar.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,"Virgo, salve."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,When duck you?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"Welcome, grave friar.?”Ithamore, be gone."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,"Know, holy sir, I am bold to solicit thee."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,Wherein?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,To get me be admitted for a nun.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,"Why, Abigail, it is not yet long since"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,2,"That I did labour thy admission,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,3,And then thou didst not like that holy life.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,Then were my thoughts so frail and unconfirm'd
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,As  I was chain'd to follies of the world:
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,3,"But now experience, purchased with grief,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,4,Has made me see the difference of things.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,5,"My sinful soul, alas, hath pac'd too long"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,6,"The fatal labyrinth of misbelief,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,7,Far from the sun that gives eternal life!
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,Who taught thee this?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"The abbess of the house,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,Whose zealous admonition I embrace:
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,3,"O, therefore, Jacomo, let me be one,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,4,"Although unworthy, of that sisterhood!"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,"Abigail, I will:  but see thou change no more,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,2,For that will be most heavy to thy soul.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,That was my father's fault.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,Thy father's! how?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"Nay, you shall pardon me.?”O Barabas,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,"Though thou deservest hardly at my hands,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,3,Yet never shall these lips bewray thy life!
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,"Come, shall we go?"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,My duty waits on you.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"What, Abigail become a nun again!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,"False and unkind! what, hast thou lost thy father?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,"And, all unknown and unconstrain'd of me,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,4,Art thou again got to the nunnery?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,5,"Now here she writes, and wills me to repent:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,6,Repentance! Spurca! what pretendeth  this?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,7,I fear she knows??tis so?”of my device
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,8,In Don Mathias' and Lodovico's deaths:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,9,"If so, 'tis time that it be seen into;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,10,"For she that varies from me in belief,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,11,"Gives great presumption that she loves me not,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,12,"Or, loving, doth dislike of something done."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,13,But who comes here?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,14,"O Ithamore, come near;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,15,"Come near, my love; come near, thy master's life,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,16,"My trusty servant, nay, my second self;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,17,"For I have now no hope but even in thee,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,18,And on that hope my happiness is built.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,19,When saw'st thou Abigail?
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,To-day.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,With whom?
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,A friar.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"A friar! false villain, he hath done the deed."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"How, sir!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"Why, made mine Abigail a nun."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,That's no lie; for she sent me for him.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,O unhappy day!
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,"False, credulous, inconstant Abigail!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,"But let 'em go:  and, Ithamore, from hence"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,4,Ne'er shall she grieve me more with her disgrace;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,5,"Ne'er shall she live to inherit aught of mine,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,6,"Be bless'd of me, nor come within my gates,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,7,"But perish underneath my bitter curse,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,8,Like Cain by Adam for his brother's death.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,O master
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"Ithamore, entreat not for her; I am mov'd,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,And she is hateful to my soul and me:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,"And, 'less  thou yield to this that I entreat,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,4,I cannot think but that thou hat'st my life.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"Who, I, master? why, I'll run to some rock,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,And throw myself headlong into the sea;
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,3,"Why, I'll do any thing for your sweet sake."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"O trusty Ithamore! no servant, but my friend!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,I here adopt thee for mine only heir:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,All that I have is thine when I am dead;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,4,"And, whilst I live, use half; spend as myself;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,5,"Here, take my keys,?”I'll give 'em thee anon;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,6,Go buy thee garments; but thou shalt not want:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,7,"Only know this, that thus thou art to do"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,8,But first go fetch me in the pot of rice
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,9,That for our supper stands upon the fire.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"I hold my head, my master's hungry .?”I go, sir."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"Thus every villain ambles after wealth,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,Although he ne'er be richer than in hope:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,"But, husht!"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"Here 'tis, master."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"Well said,  Ithamore!  What, hast thou brought"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,The ladle with thee too?
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"Yes, sir; the proverb says,  he that eats with the"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,devil had need of a long spoon; I have brought you a ladle.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"Very well, Ithamore; then now be secret;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,"And, for thy sake, whom I so dearly love,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,"Now shalt thou see the death of Abigail,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,4,That thou mayst freely live to be my heir.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"Why, master, will you poison her with a mess of rice"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,"porridge? that will preserve life, make her round and plump, and"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,3,batten  more than you are aware.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"Ay, but, Ithamore, seest thou this?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,It is a precious powder that I bought
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,"Of an Italian, in Ancona, once,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,4,"Whose operation is to bind, infect,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,5,"And poison deeply, yet not appear"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,6,In forty hours after it is ta'en.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"How, master?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"Thus, Ithamore:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,"This even they use in Malta here,??tis call'd"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,"Saint Jaques' Even,?”and then, I say, they use"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,4,To send their alms unto the nunneries:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,5,"Among the rest, bear this, and set it there:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,6,"There's a dark entry where they take it in,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,7,"Where they must neither see the messenger,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,8,Nor make inquiry who hath sent it them.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,How so?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,Belike there is some ceremony in't.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,"There, Ithamore, must thou go place this pot:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,Stay; let me spice it first.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"Pray, do, and let me help you, master."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,"Pray, let me taste first."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"Prithee, do.  What say'st thou now?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"Troth, master, I'm loath such a pot of pottage should"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,be spoiled.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"Peace, Ithamore! 'tis better so than spar'd."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,Assure thyself thou shalt have broth by the eye:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,"My purse, my coffer, and myself is thine."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,"Well, master, I go."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"Stay; first let me stir it, Ithamore."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,As fatal be it to her as the draught
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,"Of which great Alexander drunk, and died;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,4,"And with her let it work like Borgia's wine,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,5,Whereof his sire the Pope was poisoned!
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,6,"In few,  the blood of Hydra, Lerna's bane,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,7,"The juice of hebon,  and Cocytus' breath,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,8,"And all the poisons of the Stygian pool,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,9,"Break from the fiery kingdom, and in this"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,10,"Vomit your venom, and envenom her"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,11,"That, like a fiend, hath left her father thus!"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,What a blessing has he given't! was ever pot of
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,rice-porridge so sauced? .?”What shall I do with it?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"O my sweet Ithamore, go set it down;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,2,"And come again so soon as thou hast done,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,3,For I have other business for thee.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,Here's a drench to poison a whole stable of Flanders
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,mares:  I'll carry't to the nuns with a powder.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,And the horse-pestilence to boot:  away!
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,1,I am gone:
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT III.,none,2,"Pay me my wages, for my work is done."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT III.,none,1,"I'll pay thee with a vengeance, Ithamore!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,"Welcome, great basso:   how fares Calymath?"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,2,What wind drives you thus into Malta-road?
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,1,"The wind that bloweth all the world besides,"
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,2,Desire of gold.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,"Desire of gold, great sir!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,2,That's to be gotten in the Western Inde:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,3,In Malta are no golden minerals.
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,1,To you of Malta thus saith Calymath:
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,2,The time you took for respite is at hand
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,3,For the performance of your promise pass'd;
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,4,And for the tribute-money I am sent.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,"Basso, in brief, shalt have no tribute here,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,2,Nor shall the heathens live upon our spoil:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,3,"First will we raze the city-walls ourselves,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,4,"Lay waste the island, hew the temples down,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,5,"And, shipping off our goods to Sicily,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,6,"Open an entrance for the wasteful sea,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,7,"Whose billows, beating the resistless banks,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,8,Shall overflow it with their refluence.
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,1,"Well, governor, since thou hast broke the league"
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,2,"By flat denial of the promis'd tribute,"
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,3,Talk not of razing down your city-walls;
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,4,"You shall not need trouble yourselves so far,"
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,5,"For Selim Calymath shall come himself,"
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,6,"And with brass bullets batter down your towers,"
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,7,"And turn proud Malta to a wilderness,"
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,8,For these intolerable wrongs of yours:
The Jew of Malta,BASSO,ACT III.,none,9,"And so, farewell."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,1,Farewell.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,2,"And now, you men of Malta, look about,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,3,And let's provide to welcome Calymath:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,4,"Close your port-cullis, charge your basilisks,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,5,"And, as you profitably take up arms,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,6,"So now courageously encounter them,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,7,"For by this answer broken is the league,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,8,"And naught is to be look'd for now but wars,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT III.,none,9,And naught to us more welcome is than wars.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,"O brother, brother, all the nuns are sick,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,2,And physic will not help them! they must die.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,The abbess sent for me to be confess'd:
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,2,"O, what a sad confession will there be!"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,And so did fair Maria send for me:
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,2,I'll to her lodging; hereabouts she lies.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,"What, all dead, save only Abigail!"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"And I shall die too, for I feel death coming."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,Where is the friar that convers'd with me?
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,"O, he is gone to see the other nuns."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"I sent for him; but, seeing you are come,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,"Be you my ghostly father:  and first know,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,3,"That in this house I liv'd religiously,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,4,"Chaste, and devout, much sorrowing for my sins;"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,5,"But, ere I came"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,What then?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,I did offend high heaven so grievously
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,As I am almost desperate for my sins;
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,3,And one offense torments me more than all.
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,4,You knew Mathias and Don Lodowick?
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,Yes; what of them?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,My father did contract me to 'em both;
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,First to Don Lodowick:  him I never lov'd;
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,3,"Mathias was the man that I held dear,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,4,And for his sake did I become a nun.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,So:  say how was their end?
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"Both, jealous of my love, envied  each other;"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,"And by my father's practice,  which is there"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,3,"Set down at large, the gallants were both slain."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,"O, monstrous villany!"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"To work my peace, this I confess to thee:"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,Reveal it not; for then my father dies.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,Know that confession must not be reveal'd;
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,2,"The canon-law forbids it, and the priest"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,3,"That makes it known, being degraded first,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,4,"Shall be condemn'd, and then sent to the fire."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,1,"So I have heard; pray, therefore, keep it close."
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,2,"Death seizeth on my heart:  ah, gentle friar,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,3,"Convert my father that he may be sav'd,"
The Jew of Malta,ABIGAIL,ACT III.,none,4,And witness that I die a Christian!
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,"Ay, and a virgin too; that grieves me most."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,2,"But I must to the Jew, and exclaim on him,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,3,And make him stand in fear of me.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,"O brother, all the nuns are dead! let's bury them."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,"First help to bury this; then go with me,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,2,And help me to exclaim against the Jew.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,"Why, what has he done?"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,A thing that makes me tremble to unfold.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT III.,none,1,"What, has he crucified a child?"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,1,"No, but a worse thing: 'twas told me in shrift;"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,2,"Thou know'st 'tis death, an if it be reveal'd."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT III.,none,3,"Come, let's away."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,4,"No, but a worse thing: 'twas told me in shrift;"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,5,"Thou know'st 'tis death, an if it be reveal'd."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,6,"Come, let's away."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,There is no music to  a Christian's knell:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"How sweet the bells ring, now the nuns are dead,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,3,That sound at other times like tinkers' pans!
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,4,"I was afraid the poison had not wrought,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,5,"Or, though it wrought, it would have done no good,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,6,"For every year they swell, and yet they live:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,7,"Now all are dead, not one remains alive."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"That's brave, master:  but think you it will not be known?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"How can it, if we two be secret?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"For my part, fear you not."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"I'd cut thy throat, if I did."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,And reason too.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,2,But here's a royal monastery hard by;
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,3,"Good master, let me poison all the monks."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"Thou shalt not need; for, now the nuns are dead,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,They'll die with grief.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,Do you not sorrow for your daughter's death?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"No, but I grieve because she liv'd so long,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"An Hebrew born, and would become a Christian:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,3,"Cazzo,  diabolo!"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Look, look, master; here come two religious caterpillars."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,I smelt 'em ere they came.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"God-a-mercy, nose!  Come, let's begone."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Stay, wicked Jew; repent, I say, and stay."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"Thou hast offended, therefore must be damn'd."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,I fear they know we sent the poison'd broth.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"And so do I, master; therefore speak 'em fair."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Barabas, thou hast"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"Ay, that thou hast"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"True, I have money; what though I have?"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,Thou art a
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"Ay, that thou art, a"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,What needs all this? I know I am a Jew.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,Thy daughter
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"Ay, thy daughter"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"O, speak not of her! then I die with grief."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,Remember that
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"Ay, remember that"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,I must needs say that I have been a great usurer.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,Thou hast committed
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,Fornication:  but that was in another country;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"And besides, the wench is dead."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Ay, but, Barabas,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,2,Remember Mathias and Don Lodowick.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"Why, what of them?"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,I will not say that by a forged challenge they met.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"She has confess'd, and we are both undone,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,My bosom inmate!  but I must dissemble.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,3,"O holy friars, the burden of my sins"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,4,"Lie heavy  on my soul! then, pray you, tell me,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,5,Is't not too late now to turn Christian?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,6,"I have been zealous in the Jewish faith,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,7,"Hard-hearted to the poor, a covetous wretch,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,8,That would for lucre's sake have sold my soul;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,9,A hundred for a hundred I have ta'en;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,10,And now for store of wealth may I compare
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,11,With all the Jews in Malta:  but what is wealth?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,12,"I am a Jew, and therefore am I lost."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,13,"Would penance serve  for this my sin,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,14,"I could afford to whip myself to death,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,And so could I; but penance will not serve.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"To fast, to pray, and wear a shirt of hair,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,And on my knees creep to Jerusalem.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,3,"Cellars of wine, and sollars  full of wheat,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,4,"Warehouses stuff'd with spices and with drugs,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,5,"Whole chests of gold in bullion and in coin,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,6,"Besides, I know not how much weight in pearl"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,7,"Orient and round, have I within my house;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,8,At Alexandria merchandise untold;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,9,"But yesterday two ships went from this town,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,10,Their voyage will be worth ten thousand crowns;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,11,"In Florence, Venice, Antwerp, London, Seville,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,12,"Frankfort, Lubeck, Moscow, and where not,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,13,"Have I debts owing; and, in most of these,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,14,Great sums of money lying in the banco;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,15,"All this I'll give to some religious house,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,16,"So I may be baptiz'd, and live therein."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"O good Barabas, come to our house!"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,"O, no, good Barabas, come to our house!"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,2,"And, Barabas, you know"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,I know that I have highly sinn'd:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"You shall convert me, you shall have all my wealth."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"O Barabas, their laws are strict!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,I know they are; and I will be with you.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,"They wear no shirts, and they go bare-foot too."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,Then 'tis not for me; and I am resolv'd
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"You shall confess me, and have all my goods."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"Good Barabas, come to me."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"You see I answer him, and yet he stays;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"Rid him away, and go you home with me."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,I'll be with you to-night.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,Come to my house at one o'clock this night.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"You hear your answer, and you may be gone."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Why, go, get you away."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,I will not go for thee.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,Not! then I'll make thee go.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,How! dost call me rogue?
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Part 'em, master, part 'em."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"This is mere frailty:  brethren, be content."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"Friar Barnardine, go you with Ithamore:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,3,You know my mind; let me alone with him.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,Why does he go to thy house? let him be gone.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"I'll give him something, and so stop his mouth."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,I never heard of any man but he
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,3,Malign'd the order of the Jacobins:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,4,But do you think that I believe his words?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,5,"Why, brother, you converted Abigail;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,6,"And I am bound in charity to requite it,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,7,"And so I will.  O Jacomo, fail not, but come."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"But, Barabas, who shall be your godfathers?"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,2,For presently you shall be shriv'd.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"Marry, the Turk  shall be one of my godfathers,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,But not a word to any of your covent.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"I warrant thee, Barabas."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"So, now the fear is past, and I am safe;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,For he that shriv'd her is within my house:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,3,"What, if I murder'd him ere Jacomo comes?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,4,"Now I have such a plot for both their lives,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,5,As never Jew nor Christian knew the like:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,6,"One turn'd my daughter, therefore he shall die;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,7,"The other knows enough to have my life,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,8,Therefore 'tis not requisite he should live.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,9,"But are not both these wise men, to suppose"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,10,"That I will leave my house, my goods, and all,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,11,To fast and be well whipt?  I'll none of that.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,12,"Now, Friar Barnardine, I come to you:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,13,"I'll feast you, lodge you, give you fair  words,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,14,"And, after that, I and my trusty Turk"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,15,"No more, but so:  it must and shall be done."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,16,"Ithamore, tell me, is the friar asleep?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Yes; and I know not what the reason is,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,2,"Do what I can, he will not strip himself,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,3,"Nor go to bed, but sleeps in his own clothes:"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,4,I fear me he mistrusts what we intend.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,No; 'tis an order which the friars use:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"Yet, if he knew our meanings, could he scape?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"No, none can hear him, cry he ne'er so loud."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"Why, true; therefore did I place him there:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,The other chambers open towards the street.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"You loiter, master; wherefore stay we thus?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,2,"O, how I long to see him shake his heels!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"Come on, sirrah:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,Off with your girdle; make a handsome noose.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,3,"Friar, awake!"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,"What, do you mean to strangle me?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Yes, 'cause you use to confess."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"Blame not us, but the proverb,?”Confess and be"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,hanged.?”Pull hard.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR BARNARDINE,ACT IV.,none,1,"What, will you have  my life?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"Pull hard, I say.?”You would have had my goods."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Ay, and our lives too:?”therefore pull amain."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,2,"'Tis neatly done, sir; here's no print at all."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,Then is it as it should be.  Take him up.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Nay, master, be ruled by me a little.  [Takes the body,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,2,"sets it upright against the wall, and puts a staff in its hand.]"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,3,"So, let him lean upon his staff; excellent! he stands as if he"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,4,were begging of bacon.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,Who would not think but that this friar liv'd?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"What time o' night is't now, sweet Ithamore?"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,Towards one.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,Then will not Jacomo be long from hence.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,This is the hour wherein I shall proceed;
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,2,"O happy hour, wherein I shall convert"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,3,"An infidel, and bring his gold into our treasury!"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,4,But soft! is not this Barnardine? it is;
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,5,"And, understanding I should come this way,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,6,"Stands here o' purpose, meaning me some wrong,"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,7,And intercept my going to the Jew.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,8,Barnardine!
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,9,Wilt thou not speak? thou think'st I see thee not;
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,10,"Away, I'd wish thee, and let me go by:"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,11,"No, wilt thou not? nay, then, I'll force my way;"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,12,"And, see, a staff stands ready for the purpose."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,13,"As thou lik'st that, stop me another time!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"Why, how now, Jacomo! what hast thou done?"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"Why, stricken him that would have struck at me."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"Who is it? Barnardine! now, out, alas, he is slain!"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Ay, master, he's slain; look how his brains drop out"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,2,on's  nose.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"Good sirs, I have done't:  but nobody knows it but"
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,2,you two; I may escape.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,So might my man and I hang with you for company.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,No; let us bear him to the magistrates.
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"Good Barabas, let me go."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"No, pardon me; the law must have his course:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"I must be forc'd to give in evidence,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,3,"That, being importun'd by this Barnardine"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,4,"To be a Christian, I shut him out,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,5,"And there he sate:  now I, to keep my word,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,6,"And give my goods and substance to your house,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,7,"Was up thus early, with intent to go"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,8,"Unto your friary, because you stay'd."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Fie upon 'em! master, will you turn Christian, when"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,2,holy friars turn devils and murder one another?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,No; for this example I'll remain a Jew:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"Heaven bless me! what, a friar a murderer!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,3,When shall you see a Jew commit the like?
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,"Why, a Turk could ha' done no more."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,To-morrow is the sessions; you shall to it.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"Come, Ithamore, let's help to take him hence."
The Jew of Malta,FRIAR JACOMO,ACT IV.,none,1,"Villains, I am a sacred person; touch me not."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,1,"The law shall touch you; we'll but lead you, we:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,2,"'Las, I could weep at your calamity!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,3,"Take in the staff too, for that must be shown:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT IV.,none,4,Law wills that each particular be known.
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT IV.,none,1,"Pilia-Borza, didst thou meet with Ithamore?"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,1,I did.
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT IV.,none,1,And didst thou deliver my letter?
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,1,I did.
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT IV.,none,1,And what thinkest thou? will he come?
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,1,"I think so:  and yet I cannot tell; for, at the"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,2,"reading of the letter, he looked like a man of another world."
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT IV.,none,1,Why so?
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,1,That such a base slave as he should be saluted by
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,2,"such a tall  man as I am, from such a beautiful dame as you."
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT IV.,none,1,And what said he?
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,1,"Not a wise word; only gave me a nod, as who should"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,2,"say, ""Is it even so?"" and so I left him, being driven to a"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,3,non-plus at the critical aspect of my terrible countenance.
The Jew of Malta,BELLAMIRA,ACT IV.,none,1,And where didst meet him?
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,1,"Upon mine own free-hold, within forty foot of the"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,2,"gallows, conning his neck-verse,  I take it, looking of"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,3,"a friar's execution; whom I saluted with an old hempen proverb,"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,4,"Hodie tibi, cras mihi, and so I left him to the mercy of the"
The Jew of Malta,PILIA-BORZA,ACT IV.,none,5,"hangman:  but, the exercise  being done, see where he comes."
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,1,I never knew a man take his death so patiently as
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,2,this friar; he was ready to leap off ere the halter was about
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,3,"his neck; and, when the hangman had put on his hempen tippet,"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,4,"he made such haste to his prayers, as if he had had another"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,5,"cure to serve.  Well, go whither he will, I'll be none of his"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,6,"followers in haste:  and, now I think on't, going to the"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT IV.,none,7,"execution, a fellow met me with a muschatoes  like a raven's"

The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT V.,none,1,"Nor me neither; I cannot out-run you, constable.?”O, my belly!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,One dram of powder more had made all sure:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,What a damn'd slave was I!
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Make fires, heat irons, let the rack be fetch'd."
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT V.,none,1,"Nay, stay, my lord; 't may be he will confess."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Confess! what mean you, lords? who should confess?"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,Thou and thy Turk; 'twas that slew my son.
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT V.,none,1,"Guilty, my lord, I confess.  Your son and Mathias"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT V.,none,2,were both contracted unto Abigail:  forged a counterfeit
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT V.,none,3,challenge.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,Who carried that challenge?
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT V.,none,1,"I carried it, I confess; but who writ it? marry, even he that"
The Jew of Malta,ITHAMORE,ACT V.,none,2,"strangled Barnardine, poisoned the nuns and his own daughter."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,Away with him! his sight is death to me.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"For what, you men of Malta? hear me speak."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"She is a courtezan, and he a thief,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,And he my bondman:  let me have law;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,For none of this can prejudice my life.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Once more, away with him!?”You shall have law."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Devils, do your worst!?”I live in spite of you."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"As these have spoke, so be it to their souls!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,I hope the poison'd flowers will work anon.
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT V.,none,1,Was my Mathias murder'd by the Jew?
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT V.,none,2,"Ferneze, 'twas thy son that murder'd him."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Be patient, gentle madam:  it was he;"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,He forg'd the daring challenge made them fight.
The Jew of Malta,KATHARINE,ACT V.,none,1,Where is the Jew? where is that murderer?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"In prison, till the law has pass'd on him."
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT V.,none,1,"My lord, the courtezan and her man are dead;"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT V.,none,2,So is the Turk and Barabas the Jew.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,Dead!
The Jew of Malta,FIRST OFFICER,ACT V.,none,1,"Dead, my lord, and here they bring his body."
The Jew of Malta,MARTIN DEL BOSCO,ACT V.,none,1,This sudden death of his is very strange.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Wonder not at it, sir; the heavens are just;"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,Their deaths were like their lives; then think not of 'em.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,"Since they are dead, let them be buried:"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,4,"For the Jew's body, throw that o'er the walls,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,5,To be a prey for vultures and wild beasts.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,6,"So, now away and fortify the town."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"What, all alone! well fare, sleepy drink!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,I'll be reveng'd on this accursed town;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,For by my means Calymath shall enter in:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,"I'll help to slay their children and their wives,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,"To fire the churches, pull their houses down,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,6,"Take my goods too, and seize upon my lands."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,7,"I hope to see the governor a slave,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,8,"And, rowing in a galley, whipt to death."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,Whom have we there? a spy?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Yes, my good lord, one that can spy a place"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"Where you may enter, and surprize the town:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,My name is Barabas; I am a Jew.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,Art thou that Jew whose goods we heard were sold
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,For tribute-money?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"The very same, my lord:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"And since that time they have hir'd a slave, my man,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,To accuse me of a thousand villanies:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,"I was imprisoned, but scap d their hands."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,Didst break prison?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"No, no:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,I drank of poppy and cold mandrake juice;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,"And being asleep, belike they thought me dead,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,"And threw me o'er the walls:  so, or how else,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,"The Jew is here, and rests at your command."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"'Twas bravely done:  but tell me, Barabas,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,"Canst thou, as thou report'st, make Malta ours?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Fear not, my lord; for here, against the trench,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"The rock is hollow, and of purpose digg'd,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,To make a passage for the running streams
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,And common channels  of the city.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,"Now, whilst you give assault unto the walls,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,6,"I'll lead five hundred soldiers through the vault,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,7,"And rise with them i' the middle of the town,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,8,Open the gates for you to enter in;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,9,And by this means the city is your own.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"If this be true, I'll make thee governor."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"And, if it be not true, then let me die."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,Thou'st doom'd thyself.?”Assault it presently.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,"Now vail  your pride, you captive Christians,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,3,And kneel for mercy to your conquering foe:
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,4,Now where's the hope you had of haughty Spain?
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,5,"Ferneze, speak; had it not been much better"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,6,To kept  thy promise than be thus surpris'd?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"What should I say? we are captives, and must yield."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"Ay, villains, you must yield, and under Turkish yokes"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,Shall groaning bear the burden of our ire:
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,3,"And, Barabas, as erst we promis'd thee,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,4,For thy desert we make thee governor;
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,5,Use them at thy discretion.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Thanks, my lord."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"O fatal day, to fall into the hands"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,Of such a traitor and unhallow'd Jew!
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,What greater misery could heaven inflict?
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"'Tis our command:?”and, Barabas, we give,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,"To guard thy person, these our Janizaries:"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,3,"Entreat  them well, as we have used thee."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,4,"And now, brave bassoes,  come; we'll walk about"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,5,"The ruin'd town, and see the wreck we made."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,6,"Farewell, brave Jew, farewell, great Barabas!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,May all good fortune follow Calymath!
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"And now, as entrance to our safety,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,To prison with the governor and these
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,"Captains, his consorts and confederates."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,O villain! heaven will be reveng'd on thee.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,Away! no more; let him not trouble me.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"Thus hast thou gotten,  by thy policy,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,"No simple place, no small authority:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,"I now am governor of Malta; true,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,"But Malta hates me, and, in hating me,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,6,"My life's in danger; and what boots it thee,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,7,"Poor Barabas, to be the governor,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,8,Whenas  thy life shall be at their command?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,9,"No, Barabas, this must be look'd into;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,10,"And, since by wrong thou gott'st authority,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,11,Maintain it bravely by firm policy;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,12,"At least, unprofitably lose it not;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,13,"For he that liveth in authority,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,14,"And neither gets him friends nor fills his bags,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,15,"Lives like the ass that Aesop speaketh of,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,16,"That labours with a load of bread and wine,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,17,And leaves it off to snap on thistle-tops:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,18,But Barabas will be more circumspect.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,19,Begin betimes; Occasion's bald behind:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,20,"Slip not thine opportunity, for fear too late"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,21,"Thou seek'st for much, but canst not compass it."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,22,Within here!
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,My lord?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Ay, LORD; thus slaves will learn."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"Now, governor,?”stand by there, wait within,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,This is the reason that I sent for thee:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,Thou seest thy life and Malta's happiness
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,Are at my arbitrement; and Barabas
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,6,At his discretion may dispose of both:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,7,"Now tell me, governor, and plainly too,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,8,What think'st thou shall become of it and thee?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"This, Barabas; since things are in thy power,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,"I see no reason but of Malta's wreck,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,Nor hope of thee but extreme cruelty:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,4,"Nor fear I death, nor will I flatter thee."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Governor, good words; be not so furious"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,'Tis not thy life which can avail me aught;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,"Yet you do live, and live for me you shall:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,"And as for Malta's ruin, think you not"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,'Twere slender policy for Barabas
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,6,To dispossess himself of such a place?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,7,"For sith,  as once you said, within this isle,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,8,"In Malta here, that I have got my goods,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,9,"And in this city still have had success,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,10,"And now at length am grown your governor,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,11,Yourselves shall see it shall not be forgot;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,12,"For, as a friend not known but in distress,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,13,"I'll rear up Malta, now remediless."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,Will Barabas recover Malta's loss?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,Will Barabas be good to Christians?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"What wilt thou give me, governor, to procure"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,A dissolution of the slavish bands
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,Wherein the Turk hath yok'd your land and you?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,What will you give me if I render you
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,"The life of Calymath, surprise his men,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,6,And in an out-house of the city shut
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,7,"His soldiers, till I have consum'd 'em all with fire?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,8,What will you give him that procureth this?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Do but bring this to pass which thou pretendest,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,"Deal truly with us as thou intimatest,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,"And I will send amongst the citizens,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,4,And by my letters privately procure
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,5,Great sums of money for thy recompense:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,6,"Nay, more, do this, and live thou governor still."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Nay, do thou this, Ferneze, and be free:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"Governor, I enlarge thee; live with me;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,"Go walk about the city, see thy friends:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,"Tush, send not letters to 'em; go thyself,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,And let me see what money thou canst make:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,6,Here is my hand that I'll set Malta free;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,7,And thus we cast  it:  to a solemn feast
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,8,"I will invite young Selim Calymath,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,9,"Where be thou present, only to perform"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,10,"One stratagem that I'll impart to thee,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,11,"Wherein no danger shall betide thy life,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,12,And I will warrant Malta free for ever.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Here is my hand; believe me, Barabas,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,"I will be there, and do as thou desirest."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,When is the time?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Governor, presently;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"For Calymath, when he hath view'd the town,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,"Will take his leave, and sail toward Ottoman."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Then will I, Barabas, about this coin,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,And bring it with me to thee in the evening.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Do so; but fail not:  now farewell, Ferneze:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,And thus far roundly goes the business:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,"Thus, loving neither, will I live with both,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,Making a profit of my policy;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,"And he from whom my most advantage comes,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,6,Shall be my friend.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,7,This is the life we Jews are us'd to lead;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,8,"And reason too, for Christians do the like."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,9,"Well, now about effecting this device;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,10,"First, to surprise great Selim's soldiers,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,11,"And then to make provision for the feast,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,12,That at one instant all things may be done:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,13,My policy detests prevention.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,14,"To what event my secret purpose drives,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,15,I know; and they shall witness with their lives.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"Thus have we view'd the city, seen the sack,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,"And caus'd the ruins to be new-repair'd,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,3,Which with our bombards' shot and basilisk
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,4,We rent in sunder at our entry:
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,5,"And, now I see the situation,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,6,"And how secure this conquer'd island stands,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,7,"Environ'd with the Mediterranean sea,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,8,"Strong-countermin'd with other petty isles,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,9,"And, toward Calabria,  back'd by Sicily"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,10,"(Where Syracusian Dionysius reign'd),"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,11,"Two lofty turrets that command the town,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,12,I wonder how it could be conquer'd thus.
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,1,"From Barabas, Malta's governor, I bring"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,2,A message unto mighty Calymath:
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,3,"Hearing his sovereign was bound for sea,"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,4,"To sail to Turkey, to great Ottoman,"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,5,He humbly would entreat your majesty
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,6,"To come and see his homely citadel,"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,7,And banquet with him ere thou leav'st the isle.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,To banquet with him in his citadel!
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,"I fear me, messenger, to feast my train"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,3,"Within a town of war so lately pillag'd,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,4,Will be too costly and too troublesome:
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,5,"Yet would I gladly visit Barabas,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,6,For well has Barabas deserv'd of us.
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,1,"Selim, for that, thus saith the governor,"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,2,"That he hath in  store a pearl so big,"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,3,"So precious, and withal so orient,"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,4,"As, be it valu'd but indifferently,"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,5,The price thereof will serve to entertain
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,6,Selim and all his soldiers for a month;
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,7,Therefore he humbly would entreat your highness
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,8,Not to depart till he has feasted you.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"I cannot feast my men in Malta-walls,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,Except he place his tables in the streets.
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,1,"Know, Selim, that there is a monastery"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,2,Which standeth as an out-house to the town;
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,3,"There will he banquet them; but thee at home,"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,4,With all thy bassoes and brave followers.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"Well, tell the governor we grant his suit;"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,We'll in this summer-evening feast with him.
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,1,"I shall, my lord."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"And now, bold bassoes, let us to our tents,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,"And meditate how we may grace us best,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,3,To solemnize our governor's great feast.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"In this, my countrymen, be rul'd by me:"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,Have special care that no man sally forth
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,Till you shall hear a culverin discharg'd
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,4,"By him that bears the linstock,  kindled thus;"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,5,"Then issue out and come to rescue me,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,6,"For happily I shall be in distress,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,7,Or you released of this servitude.
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT V.,none,1,"Rather than thus to live as Turkish thralls,"
The Jew of Malta,FIRST KNIGHT,ACT V.,none,2,What will we not adventure?
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"On, then; be gone."
The Jew of Malta,KNIGHTS,ACT V.,none,1,"Farewell, grave governor."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,How stand the cords? how hang these hinges? fast?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,Are all the cranes and pulleys sure?
The Jew of Malta,FIRST CARPENTER,ACT V.,none,1,All fast.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Leave nothing loose, all levell'd to my mind."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"Why, now I see that you have art, indeed:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,"There, carpenters, divide that gold amongst you;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,"Go, swill in bowls of sack and muscadine;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,"Down to the cellar, taste of all my wines."
The Jew of Malta,FIRST CARPENTER,ACT V.,none,1,"We shall, my lord, and thank you."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"And, if you like them, drink your fill and die;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"For, so I live, perish may all the world!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,"Now, Selim Calymath, return me word"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,"That thou wilt come, and I am satisfied."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,"Now, sirrah; what, will he come?"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,1,He will; and has commanded all his men
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,2,"To come ashore, and march through Malta-streets,"
The Jew of Malta,MESSENGER,ACT V.,none,3,That thou mayst feast them in thy citadel.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,Then now are all things as my wish would have 'em;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,There wanteth nothing but the governor's pelf;
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,"And see, he brings it."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"With free consent, a hundred thousand pounds."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Pounds say'st thou, governor? well, since it is no more,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"I'll satisfy myself with that; nay, keep it still,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,"For, if I keep not promise, trust not me:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,"And, governor, now partake my policy."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,"First, for his army, they are sent before,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,6,"Enter'd the monastery, and underneath"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,7,"In several places are field-pieces pitch'd,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,8,"Bombards, whole barrels full of gunpowder,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,9,"That on the sudden shall dissever it,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,10,"And batter all the stones about their ears,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,11,Whence none can possibly escape alive:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,12,"Now, as for Calymath and his consorts,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,13,"Here have I made a dainty gallery,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,14,"The floor whereof, this cable being cut,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,15,"Doth fall asunder, so that it doth sink"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,16,Into a deep pit past recovery.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,17,"Here, hold that knife; and, when thou seest he comes,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,18,"And with his bassoes shall be blithely set,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,19,"A warning-piece shall be shot off  from the tower,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,20,"To give thee knowledge when to cut the cord,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,21,"And fire the house.  Say, will not this be brave?"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"O, excellent! here, hold thee, Barabas;"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,I trust thy word; take what I promis'd thee.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"No, governor; I'll satisfy thee first;"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,Thou shalt not live in doubt of any thing.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,"Stand close, for here they come."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,"A kingly kind of trade, to purchase towns"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,"By treachery, and sell 'em by deceit?"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,6,"Now tell me, worldlings, underneath the sun"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,7,If greater falsehood ever has been done?
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"Come, my companion-bassoes:  see, I pray,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,How busy Barabas is there above
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,3,To entertain us in his gallery:
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,4,"Let us salute him.?”Save thee, Barabas!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Welcome, great Calymath!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,How the slave jeers at him!
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Will't please thee, mighty Selim Calymath,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,To ascend our homely stairs?
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"Ay, Barabas."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,"Come, bassoes, ascend."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Stay, Calymath;"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,For I will shew thee greater courtesy
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,Than Barabas would have afforded thee.
The Jew of Malta,KNIGHT,ACT V.,none,1,Sound a charge there!
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,How now! what means this?
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"Help, help me, Christians, help!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"See, Calymath! this was devis'd for thee."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"Treason, treason! bassoes, fly!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"No, Selim, do not fly:"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,"See his end first, and fly then if thou canst."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"O, help me, Selim! help me, Christians!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"Governor, why stand you all so pitiless?"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Should I in pity of thy plaints or thee,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,"Accursed Barabas, base Jew, relent?"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,"No, thus I'll see thy treachery repaid,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,4,But wish thou hadst behav'd thee otherwise.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"You will not help me, then?"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"No, villain, no."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,1,"And, villains, know you cannot help me now."
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,2,"Then, Barabas, breathe forth thy latest fate,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,3,And in the fury of thy torments strive
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,4,To end thy life with resolution.
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,5,"Know, governor, 'twas I that slew thy son,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,6,I fram'd the challenge that did make them meet:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,7,"Know, Calymath, I aim'd thy overthrow:"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,8,"And, had I but escap'd this stratagem,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,9,"I would have brought confusion on you all,"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,10,"Damn'd Christian  dogs, and Turkish infidels!"
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,11,But now begins the extremity of heat
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,12,To pinch me with intolerable pangs:
The Jew of Malta,BARABAS,ACT V.,none,13,"Die, life! fly, soul! tongue, curse thy fill, and die!"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"Tell me, you Christians, what doth this portend?"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,This train  he laid to have entrapp'd thy life;
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,"Now, Selim, note the unhallow'd deeds of Jews;"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,"Thus he determin'd to have handled thee,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,4,But I have rather chose to save thy life.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,Was this the banquet he prepar'd for us?
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,"Let's hence, lest further mischief be pretended."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Nay, Selim, stay; for, since we have thee here,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,We will not let thee part so suddenly:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,"Besides, if we should let thee go, all's one,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,4,"For with thy galleys couldst thou not get hence,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,5,Without fresh men to rig and furnish them.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"Tush, governor, take thou no care for that;"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,"My men are all aboard,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,3,And do attend my coming there by this.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Why, heard'st thou not the trumpet sound a charge?"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"Yes, what of that?"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Why, then the house was fir'd,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,"Blown up, and all thy soldiers massacred."
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"O, monstrous treason!"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,A Jew's courtesy;
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,"For he that did by treason work our fall,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,By treason hath deliver'd thee to us:
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,4,"Know, therefore, till thy father hath made good"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,5,"The ruins done to Malta and to us,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,6,"Thou canst not part; for Malta shall be freed,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,7,Or Selim ne'er return to Ottoman.
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,1,"Nay, rather, Christians, let me go to Turkey,"
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,2,In person there to mediate  your peace:
The Jew of Malta,CALYMATH,ACT V.,none,3,To keep me here will naught advantage you.
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,1,"Content thee, Calymath, here thou must stay,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,2,And live in Malta prisoner; for come all  the world
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,3,"To rescue thee, so will we guard us now,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,4,"As sooner shall they drink the ocean dry,"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,5,"Than conquer Malta, or endanger us."
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,6,"So, march away; and let due praise be given"
The Jew of Malta,FERNEZE,ACT V.,none,7,"Neither to Fate nor Fortune, but to Heaven."
