Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Brother Cosroe, I find myself agriev'd;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Yet insufficient to express the same,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,For it requires a great and thundering speech:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Good brother, tell the cause unto my lords;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,I know you have a better wit than I.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Unhappy Persia,?”that in former age"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Hast been the seat of mighty conquerors,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"That, in their prowess and their policies,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Have triumph'd over Afric,  and the bounds"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,Of Europe where the sun dares scarce appear
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"For freezing meteors and congealed cold,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,Now to be rul'd and govern'd by a man
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"At whose birth-day Cynthia with Saturn join'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,"And Jove, the Sun, and Mercury denied"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,To shed their  influence in his fickle brain!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,11,"Now Turks and Tartars shake their swords at thee,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,12,Meaning to mangle all thy provinces.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Brother, I see your meaning well enough,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,And through  your planets I perceive you think
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,I am not wise enough to be a king:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"But I refer me to my noblemen,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"That know my wit, and can be witnesses."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"I might command you to be slain for this,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,"Meander, might I not?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Not for so small a fault, my sovereign lord."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"I mean it not, but yet I know I might."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Yet live; yea, live; Mycetes wills it so."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"Meander, thou, my faithful counsellor,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Declare the cause of my conceived grief,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"Which is, God knows, about that Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"That, like a fox in midst of harvest-time,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,Doth prey upon my flocks of passengers;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"And, as I hear, doth mean to pull my plumes:"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,Therefore 'tis good and meet for to be wise.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,Oft have I heard your majesty complain
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Of Tamburlaine, that sturdy Scythian thief,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,That robs your merchants of Persepolis
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Trading by land unto the Western Isles,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,And in your confines with his lawless train
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"Daily commits incivil  outrages,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,Hoping (misled by dreaming prophecies)
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"To reign in Asia, and with barbarous arms"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,To make himself the monarch of the East:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,"But, ere he march in Asia, or display"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,11,"His vagrant ensign in the Persian fields,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,12,"Your grace hath taken order by Theridamas,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,13,"Charg'd with a thousand horse, to apprehend"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,14,And bring him captive to your highness' throne.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Full true thou speak'st, and like thyself, my lord,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,Whom I may term a Damon for thy love:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"Therefore 'tis best, if so it like you all,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,To send my thousand horse incontinent
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,To apprehend that paltry Scythian.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"How like you this, my honourable lords?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,Is it not a kingly resolution?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"It cannot choose, because it comes from you."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Then hear thy charge, valiant Theridamas,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"The chiefest  captain of Mycetes' host,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"The hope of Persia, and the very legs"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Whereon our state doth lean as on a staff,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,That holds us up and foils our neighbour foes:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"Thou shalt be leader of this thousand horse,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,Whose foaming gall with rage and high disdain
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,Have sworn the death of wicked Tamburlaine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,"Go frowning forth; but come thou smiling home,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,As did Sir Paris with the Grecian dame:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,11,Return with speed; time passeth swift away;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,12,"Our life is frail, and we may die to-day."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Before the moon renew her borrow'd light,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Doubt not, my lord and gracious sovereign,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,But Tamburlaine and that Tartarian rout
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Shall either perish by our warlike hands,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,Or plead for mercy at your highness' feet.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Go, stout Theridamas; thy words are swords,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,And with thy looks thou conquerest all thy foes.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"I long to see thee back return from thence,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,That I may view these milk-white steeds of mine
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"All loaden with the heads of killed men,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"And, from their knees even to their hoofs below,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,Besmear'd with blood that makes a dainty show.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Then now, my lord, I humbly take my leave."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Theridamas, farewell ten thousand times."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Ah, Menaphon, why stay'st thou thus behind,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,When other men press  forward for renown?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Go, Menaphon, go into Scythia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,And foot by foot follow Theridamas.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Nay, pray you,  let him stay; a greater"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,Fits Menaphon than warring with a thief:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"Create him pro-rex of all  Africa,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"That he may win the Babylonians' hearts,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"Which will revolt from Persian government,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,Unless they have a wiser king than you.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,Unless they have a wiser king than you!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"These are his words; Meander, set them down."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"And add this to them,?”that all Asia"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,Lament to see the folly of their king.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Well, here I swear by this my royal seat"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"You may do well to kiss it, then."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Emboss'd with silk as best beseems my state,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,To be reveng'd for these contemptuous words!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"O, where is duty and allegiance now?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,Fled to the Caspian or the Ocean main?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"What shall I call thee? brother? no, a foe;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"Monster of nature, shame unto thy stock,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,That dar'st presume thy sovereign for to mock!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"Meander, come:  I am abus'd, Meander."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"How now, my lord! what, mated  and amaz'd"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,To hear the king thus threaten like himself!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Ah, Menaphon, I pass not  for his threats!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,The plot is laid by Persian noblemen
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,And captains of the Median garrisons
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,To crown me emperor of Asia:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,But this it is that doth excruciate
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"The very substance of my vexed soul,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,"To see our neighbours, that were wont to quake"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"And tremble at the Persian monarch's name,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,Now sit and laugh our regiment  to scorn;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,"And that which might resolve  me into tears,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,11,Men from the farthest equinoctial line
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,12,"Have swarm'd in troops into the Eastern India,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,13,"Lading their ships  with gold and precious stones,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,14,And made their spoils from all our provinces.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"This should entreat your highness to rejoice,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,Since Fortune gives you opportunity
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,To gain the title of a conqueror
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,By curing of this maimed empery.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"Afric and Europe bordering on your land,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"And continent to your dominions,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,"How easily may you, with a mighty host,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"Pass  into Graecia, as did Cyrus once,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,"And cause them to withdraw their forces home,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,Lest you  subdue the pride of Christendom!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"But, Menaphon, what means this trumpet's sound?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Behold, my lord, Ortygius and the rest"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,Bringing the crown to make you emperor!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Magnificent and mighty prince Cosroe,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"We, in the name of other Persian states"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"And commons of this mighty monarchy,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,Present thee with th' imperial diadem.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"The warlike soldiers and the gentlemen,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,That heretofore have fill'd Persepolis
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"With Afric captains taken in the field,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Whose ransom made them march in coats of gold,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"With costly jewels hanging at their ears,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"And shining stones upon their lofty crests,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,"Now living idle in the walled towns,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"Wanting both pay and martial discipline,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,"Begin in troops to threaten civil war,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,And openly exclaim against their  king:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,11,"Therefore, to stay all sudden mutinies,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,12,We will invest your highness emperor;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,13,Whereat the soldiers will conceive more joy
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,14,Than did the Macedonians at the spoil
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,15,Of great Darius and his wealthy host.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Well, since I see the state of Persia droop"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"And languish in my brother's government,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"I willingly receive th' imperial crown,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"And vow to wear it for my country's good,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,In spite of them shall malice my estate.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"And, in assurance of desir'd success,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,We here do crown thee monarch of the East
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,Emperor of Asia and Persia;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,Great lord of Media and Armenia;

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"Chief lord of all the wide vast Euxine Sea,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,And of the ever-raging  Caspian Lake.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ALL,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Long live Cosroe, mighty emperor!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,And Jove may  never let me longer live
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Than I may seek to gratify your love,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,And cause the soldiers that thus honour me
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,To triumph over many provinces!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,By whose desires of discipline in arms
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"I doubt not shortly but to reign sole king,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,And with the army of Theridamas
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"(Whither we presently will fly, my lords,)"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,To rest secure against my brother's force.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"We knew,  my lord, before we brought the crown,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,Intending your investion so near
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"The residence of your despised brother,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,The lords  would not be too exasperate
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,To injury  or suppress your worthy title;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"Or, if they would, there are in readiness"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,"Ten thousand horse to carry you from hence,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,In spite of all suspected enemies.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"I know it well, my lord, and thank you all."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Sound up the trumpets, then."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ALL,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,God save the king!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ALL,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,God save the king!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Come, lady, let not this appal your thoughts;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,The jewels and the treasure we have ta'en
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"Shall be reserv'd, and you in better state"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"Than if you were arriv'd in Syria,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"Even in the circle of your father's arms,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,The mighty Soldan of Aegyptia.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Ah, shepherd, pity my distressed plight!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"(If, as thou seem'st, thou art so mean a man,)"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,And seek not to enrich thy followers
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"By lawless rapine from a silly maid,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"Who, travelling  with these Median lords"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"To Memphis, from my uncle's country of Media,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"Where, all my youth, I have been governed,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,"Have pass'd the army of the mighty Turk,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,Bearing his privy-signet and his hand
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,To safe-conduct us thorough  Africa.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MAGNETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"And, since we have arriv'd in Scythia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MAGNETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Besides rich presents from the puissant Cham,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MAGNETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,We have his highness' letters to command
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MAGNETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"Aid and assistance, if we stand in need."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,But now you see these letters and commands
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,Are countermanded by a greater man;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,And through my provinces you must expect
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"Letters of conduct from my mightiness,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,If you intend to keep your treasure safe.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"But, since I love to live at liberty,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,As easily may you get the Soldan's crown
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,As any prizes out of my precinct;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,For they are friends that help to wean my state
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,"Till men and kingdoms help to strengthen it,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,11,And must maintain my life exempt from servitude.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,12,"But, tell me, madam, is your grace betroth'd?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"I am, my lord,?”for so you do import."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"I am a lord, for so my deeds shall prove;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,And yet a shepherd by my parentage.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"But, lady, this fair face and heavenly hue"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"Must grace his bed that conquers Asia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"And means to be a terror to the world,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,Measuring the limits of his empery
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"By east and west, as Phoebus doth his course."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,"Lie here, ye weeds, that I disdain to wear!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,This complete armour and this curtle-axe
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,Are adjuncts more beseeming Tamburlaine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,11,"And, madam, whatsoever you esteem"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,12,"Of this success, and loss unvalued,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,13,Both may invest you empress of the East;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,14,And these that seem but silly country swains
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,15,May have the leading of so great an host
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,16,"As with their weight shall make the mountains quake,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,17,"Even as when windy exhalations,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,18,"Fighting for passage, tilt within the earth."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"As princely lions, when they rouse themselves,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Stretching their paws, and threatening herds of beasts,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,So in his armour looketh Tamburlaine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"Methinks I see kings kneeling at his feet,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,And he with frowning brows and fiery looks
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,Spurning their crowns from off their captive heads.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"And making thee and me, Techelles, kings,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,That even to death will follow Tamburlaine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Nobly resolv'd, sweet friends and followers!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"These lords perhaps do scorn our estimates,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,And think we prattle with distemper'd spirits:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"But, since they measure our deserts so mean,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"That in conceit  bear empires on our spears,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"Affecting thoughts coequal with the clouds,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,They shall be kept our forced followers
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,Till with their eyes they view us emperors.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"The gods, defenders of the innocent."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Will never prosper your intended drifts,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,That thus oppress poor friendless passengers.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"Therefore at least admit us liberty,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,Even as thou hop'st to be eternized
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,By living Asia's mighty emperor.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,I hope our lady's treasure and our own
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,May serve for ransom to our liberties:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"Return our mules and empty camels back,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"That we may travel into Syria,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"Where her betrothed lord, Alcidamus,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,Expects the arrival of her highness' person.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MAGNETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"And wheresoever we repose ourselves,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MAGNETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,We will report but well of Tamburlaine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,Disdains Zenocrate to live with me?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Or you, my lords, to be my followers?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,Think you I weigh this treasure more than you?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,Not all the gold in India's wealthy arms
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,Shall buy the meanest soldier in my train.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"Zenocrate, lovelier than the love of Jove,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"Brighter than is the silver Rhodope,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,"Fairer than whitest snow on Scythian hills,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,Thy person is more worth to Tamburlaine
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,"Than the possession of the Persian crown,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,11,Which gracious stars have promis'd at my birth.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,12,"A hundred Tartars shall attend on thee,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,13,Mounted on steeds swifter than Pegasus;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,14,"Thy garments shall be made of Median silk,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,15,"Enchas'd with precious jewels of mine own,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,16,More rich and valurous  than Zenocrate's;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,17,With milk-white harts upon an ivory sled
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,18,"Thou shalt be drawn amidst the frozen pools,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,19,"And scale the icy mountains' lofty tops,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,20,Which with thy beauty will be soon resolv'd:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,21,"My martial prizes, with five hundred men,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,22,"Won on the fifty-headed Volga's waves,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,23,"Shall we all offer  to Zenocrate,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,24,And then myself to fair Zenocrate.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,What now! in love?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Techelles, women must be flattered:"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,But this is she with whom I am in  love.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDIER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"News, news!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,How now! what's the matter?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDIER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"A thousand Persian horsemen are at hand,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDIER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,Sent from the king to overcome us all.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"How now, my lords of Egypt, and Zenocrate!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Now must your jewels be restor'd again,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"And I, that triumph'd  so, be overcome?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"How say you, lordings? is not this your hope?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,We hope yourself will willingly restore them.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Such hope, such fortune, have the thousand horse."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Soft ye, my lords, and sweet Zenocrate!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,You must be forced from me ere you go.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,A thousand horsemen! we five hundred foot!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,An odds too great for us to stand against.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,But are they rich? and is their armour good!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDIER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Their plumed helms are wrought with beaten gold,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDIER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Their swords enamell'd, and about their necks"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDIER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,Hang massy chains of gold down to the waist;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDIER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,In every part exceeding brave  and rich.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,Then shall we fight courageously with them?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,Or look you I should play the orator?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,No; cowards and faint-hearted runaways
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,Look for orations when the foe is near:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,Our swords shall play the orators for us.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Come, let us meet them at the mountain-top,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,And with a sudden and an hot alarum
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,Drive all their horses headlong down the hill.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Come, let us march."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Stay, Techelles; ask a parle first."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Open the mails,  yet guard the treasure sure:"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"Lay out our golden wedges to the view,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,That their reflections may amaze the Persians;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,And look we friendly on them when they come:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"But, if they offer word or violence,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"We'll fight, five hundred men-at-arms to one,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,Before we part with our possession;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,"And 'gainst the general we will lift our swords,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,"And either lance  his greedy thirsting throat,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,11,"Or take him prisoner, and his chain shall serve"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,12,For manacles till he be ransom'd home.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,I hear them come:  shall we encounter them?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Keep all your standings, and not stir a foot:"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,Myself will bide the danger of the brunt.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,Where is this  Scythian Tamburlaine?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Whom seek'st thou, Persian?  I am Tamburlaine."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,Tamburlaine!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,A Scythian shepherd so embellished
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,With nature's pride and richest furniture!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,His looks do menace heaven and dare the gods;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"His fiery eyes are fix'd upon the earth,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"As if he now devis'd some stratagem,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,Or meant to pierce Avernus' darksome vaults
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,To pull the triple-headed dog from hell.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Noble and mild this Persian seems to be,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,If outward habit judge the inward man.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,His deep affections make him passionate.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,With what a majesty he rears his looks!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"In thee, thou valiant man of Persia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,I see the folly of thy  emperor.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"Art thou but captain of a thousand horse,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"That by characters graven in thy brows,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"And by thy martial face and stout aspect,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,Deserv'st to have the leading of an host?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,"Forsake thy king, and do but join with me,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,And we will triumph over all the world:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,"I hold the Fates bound fast in iron chains,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,11,And with my hand turn Fortune's wheel about;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,12,And sooner shall the sun fall from his sphere
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,13,Than Tamburlaine be slain or overcome.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,14,"Draw forth thy sword, thou mighty man-at-arms,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,15,"Intending but to raze my charmed skin,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,16,And Jove himself will stretch his hand from heaven
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,17,"To ward the blow, and shield me safe from harm."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,18,"See, how he rains down heaps of gold in showers,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,19,As if he meant to give my soldiers pay!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,20,"And, as a sure and grounded argument"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,21,"That I shall be the monarch of the East,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,22,"He sends this Soldan's daughter rich and brave,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,23,To be my queen and portly emperess.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,24,"If thou wilt stay with me, renowmed  man,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,25,"And lead thy thousand horse with my conduct,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,26,"Besides thy share of this Egyptian prize,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,27,Those thousand horse shall sweat with martial spoil
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,28,Of conquer'd kingdoms and of cities sack'd:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,29,Both we will walk upon the lofty cliffs;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,30,"And Christian merchants,  that with Russian stems"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,31,"Plough up huge furrows in the Caspian Sea,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,32,Shall vail  to us as lords of all the lake;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,33,"Both we will reign as consuls of the earth,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,34,And mighty kings shall be our senators.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,35,Jove sometime masked in a shepherd's weed;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,36,And by those steps that he hath scal'd the heavens
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,37,May we become immortal like the gods.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,38,"Join with me now in this my mean estate,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,39,"(I call it mean, because, being yet obscure,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,40,"The nations far-remov'd admire me not,)"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,41,And when my name and honour shall be spread
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,42,"As far as Boreas claps his brazen wings,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,43,"Or fair Bootes  sends his cheerful light,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,44,"Then shalt thou be competitor  with me,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,45,And sit with Tamburlaine in all his majesty.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Not Hermes, prolocutor to the gods,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,Could use persuasions more pathetical.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,Nor are Apollo's oracles more true
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,Than thou shalt find my vaunts substantial.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"We are his friends; and, if the Persian king"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Should offer present dukedoms to our state,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,We think it loss to make exchange for that
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,We are assur'd of by our friend's success.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"And kingdoms at the least we all expect,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Besides the honour in assured conquests,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"Where kings shall crouch unto our conquering swords,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"And hosts of soldiers stand amaz'd at us,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"When with their fearful tongues they shall confess,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,These are the men that all the world admires.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,What strong enchantments tice my yielding soul
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"To these  resolved, noble Scythians!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,But shall I prove a traitor to my king?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,No; but the trusty friend of Tamburlaine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Won with thy words, and conquer'd with thy looks,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"I yield myself, my men, and horse to thee,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"To be partaker of thy good or ill,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,As long as life maintains Theridamas.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Theridamas, my friend, take here my hand,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Which is as much as if I swore by heaven,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,And call'd the gods to witness of my vow.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,Thus shall my heart be still combin'd with thine
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"Until our bodies turn to elements,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,And both our souls aspire celestial thrones.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"Techelles and Casane, welcome him."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Welcome, renowmed  Persian, to us all!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,Long may Theridamas remain with us!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"These are my friends, in whom I more rejoice"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,Than doth the king of Persia in his crown;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"And, by the love of Pylades and Orestes,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"Whose statues  we adore in Scythia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,Thyself and them shall never part from me
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,Before I crown you kings  in Asia.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"Make much of them, gentle Theridamas,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,And they will never leave thee till the death.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Nor thee nor them,  thrice-noble Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Shall want my heart to be with gladness pierc'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,To do you honour and security.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"A thousand thanks, worthy Theridamas."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"And now, fair madam, and my noble lords,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"If you will  willingly remain with me,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,You shall have honours as your merits be;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,Or else you shall be forc'd with slavery.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"We yield unto thee, happy Tamburlaine."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"For you, then, madam, I am out of doubt."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"I must be pleas'd perforce,?”wretched Zenocrate!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"I must be pleas'd perforce,?”wretched Zenocrate!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Thus far are we towards Theridamas,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"And valiant Tamburlaine, the man of fame,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,The man that in the forehead of his fortune
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,Bears figures of renown and miracle.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"But tell me, that hast seen him, Menaphon,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"What stature wields he, and what personage?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Of stature tall, and straightly fashioned,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Like his desire, lift upwards and divine;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"So large of limbs, his joints so strongly knit,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,Such breadth of shoulders as might mainly bear
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"Old Atlas' burden; 'twixt his manly pitch,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"A pearl more worth than all the world is plac'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,Wherein by curious sovereignty of art
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"Are fix'd his piercing instruments of sight,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,Whose fiery circles bear encompassed
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,"A heaven of heavenly bodies in their spheres,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,11,That guides his steps and actions to the throne
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,12,Where honour sits invested royally;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,13,"Pale of complexion, wrought in him with passion,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,14,Thirsting with sovereignty and  love of arms;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,15,"His lofty brows in folds do figure death,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,16,And in their smoothness amity and life;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,17,"About them hangs a knot of amber hair,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,18,"Wrapped in curls, as fierce Achilles' was,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,19,"On which the breath of heaven delights to play,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,20,Making it dance with wanton majesty;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,21,"His arms and fingers long and sinewy,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,22,Betokening valour and excess of strength;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,23,In every part proportion'd like the man
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MENAPHON,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,24,Should make the world subdu'd  to Tamburlaine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,Well hast thou pourtray'd in thy terms of life
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,The face and personage of a wondrous man:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,Nature doth strive with Fortune  and his stars
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,To make him famous in accomplish'd worth;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,And well his merits shew him to be made
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"His fortune's master and the king of men,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,"That could persuade, at such a sudden pinch,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"With reasons of his valour and his life,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,A thousand sworn and overmatching foes.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,"Then, when our powers in points of swords are join'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,11,"And clos'd in compass of the killing bullet,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,12,Though strait the passage and the port  be made
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,13,"That leads to palace of my brother's life,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,14,Proud is  his fortune if we pierce it not;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,15,"And, when the princely Persian diadem"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,16,"Shall overweigh his weary witless head,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,17,"And fall, like mellow'd fruit, with shakes of death,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,18,In fair  Persia noble Tamburlaine
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,19,"Shall be my regent, and remain as king."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,In happy hour we have set the crown
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Upon your kingly head, that seeks our honour"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,In joining with the man ordain'd by heaven
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,To further every action to the best.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,He that with shepherds and a little spoil
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Durst, in disdain of wrong and tyranny,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"Defend his freedom 'gainst a monarchy,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"What will he do supported by a king,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"Leading a troop of gentlemen and lords,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CENEUS,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,And stuff'd with treasure for his highest thoughts!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,And such shall wait on worthy Tamburlaine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Our army will be forty thousand strong,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,When Tamburlaine and brave Theridamas
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,Have met us by the river Araris;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"And all conjoin'd to meet the witless king,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"That now is marching near to Parthia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,"And, with unwilling soldiers faintly arm'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,To seek revenge on me and Tamburlaine;

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"I tell you true, my heart is swoln with wrath"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"On this same thievish villain Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"And of  that false Cosroe, my traitorous brother."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"Would it not grieve a king to be so abus'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,And have a thousand horsemen ta'en away?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"And, which is worse,  to have his diadem"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,Sought for by such scald knaves as love him not?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,"I think it would:  well, then, by heavens I swear,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,"Aurora shall not peep out of her doors,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,11,"But I will have Cosroe by the head,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,12,And kill proud Tamburlaine with point of sword.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,13,"Tell you the rest, Meander:  I have said."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Then, having pass'd Armenian deserts now,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"And pitch'd our tents under the Georgian hills,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"Whose tops are cover'd with Tartarian thieves,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"That lie in ambush, waiting for a prey,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"What should we do but bid them battle straight,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,And rid the world of those detested troops?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"Lest, if we let them linger here a while,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,They gather strength by power of fresh supplies.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,This country swarms with vile outragious men
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,"That live by rapine and by lawless spoil,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,11,Fit soldiers for the  wicked Tamburlaine;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,12,And he that could with gifts and promises
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,13,"Inveigle him that led a thousand horse,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,14,"And make him false his faith unto his  king,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,15,Will quickly win such as be  like himself.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,16,Therefore cheer up your minds; prepare to fight:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,17,"He that can take or slaughter Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,18,Shall rule the province of Albania;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,19,"Who brings that traitor's head, Theridamas,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,20,"Shall have a government in Media,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,21,Beside  the spoil of him and all his train:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,22,"But, if Cosroe (as our spials say,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,23,"And as we know) remains with Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,24,"His highness' pleasure is that he should live,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,25,And be reclaim'd with princely lenity.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SPY,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"An hundred horsemen of my company,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SPY,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Scouting abroad upon these champion  plains,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SPY,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,Have view'd the army of the Scythians;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SPY,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,Which make report it far exceeds the king's.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Suppose they be in number infinite,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Yet being void of martial discipline,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"All running headlong, greedy after  spoils,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"And more regarding gain than victory,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"Like to the cruel brothers of the earth,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"Sprung  of the teeth of  dragons venomous,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"Their careless swords shall lance  their fellows' throats,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,And make us triumph in their overthrow.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Was there such brethren, sweet Meander, say,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,That sprung of teeth of dragons venomous?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"So poets say, my lord."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,And 'tis a pretty toy to be a poet.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Well, well, Meander, thou art deeply read;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"And having thee, I have a jewel sure."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"Go on, my lord, and give your charge, I say;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,Thy wit will make us conquerors to-day.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Then, noble soldiers, to entrap these thieves"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"That live confounded in disorder'd troops,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"If wealth or riches may prevail with them,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"We have our camels laden all with gold,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,Which you that be but common soldiers
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,Shall fling in every corner of the field;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"And, while the base-born Tartars take it up,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,"You, fighting more for honour than for gold,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,Shall massacre those greedy-minded slaves;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,"And, when their scatter'd army is subdu'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,11,"And you march on their slaughter'd carcasses,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,12,"Share equally the gold that bought their lives,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,13,And live like gentlemen in Persia.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,14,"Strike up the  drum, and march courageously:"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,15,Fortune herself doth sit upon our crests.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"He tells you true, my masters; so he does."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Drums, why sound ye not when Meander speaks?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"He tells you true, my masters; so he does."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,"Drums, why sound ye not when Meander speaks?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"USUMCASANE,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Now, worthy Tamburlaine, have I repos'd"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,In thy approved fortunes all my hope.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"What think'st thou, man, shall come of our attempts?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,"For, even as from assured oracle,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,I take thy doom for satisfaction.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"And so mistake you not a whit, my lord;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,For fates and oracles  heaven have sworn
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"To royalize the deeds of Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,And make them blest that share in his attempts:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"And doubt you not but, if you favour me,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,And let my fortunes and my valour sway
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,7,"To some  direction in your martial deeds,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,8,The world will  strive with hosts of men-at-arms
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,9,To swarm unto the ensign I support.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,10,"The host of Xerxes, which by fame is said"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,11,"To drink the mighty Parthian Araris,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,12,Was but a handful to that we will have:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,13,"Our quivering lances, shaking in the air,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,14,"And bullets, like Jove's dreadful thunderbolts,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,15,"Enroll'd in flames and fiery smouldering mists,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,16,Shall threat the gods more than Cyclopian wars;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,17,"And with our sun-bright armour, as we march,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,18,"We'll chase the stars from heaven, and dim their eyes"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,19,That stand and muse at our admired arms.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"You see, my lord, what working words he hath;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"But, when you see his actions top  his speech,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"Your speech will stay, or so extol his worth"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,As I shall be commended and excus'd
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,For turning my poor charge to his direction:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,"And these his two renowmed  friends, my lord,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,7,Would make one thirst  and strive to be retain'd
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,8,In such a great degree of amity.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,With duty and  with amity we yield
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,Our utmost service to the fair  Cosroe.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,Which I esteem as portion of my crown.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"Usumcasane and Techelles both,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"When she  that rules in Rhamnus'  golden gates,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,"And makes a passage for all prosperous arms,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"Shall make me solely emperor of Asia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,Then shall your meeds  and valours be advanc'd
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,7,To rooms of honour and nobility.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Then haste, Cosroe, to be king alone,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,That I with these my friends and all my men
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,May triumph in our long-expected fate.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,"The king, your brother, is now hard at hand:"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"Meet with the fool, and rid your royal shoulders"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,Of such a burden as outweighs the sands
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,7,And all the craggy rocks of Caspia.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"My lord,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,We have discovered the enemy
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,Ready to charge you with a mighty army.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Come, Tamburlaine; now whet thy winged sword,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"And lift thy lofty arm into  the clouds,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"That it may reach the king of Persia's crown,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,And set it safe on my victorious head.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"See where it is, the keenest curtle-axe"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,That e'er made passage thorough Persian arms!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,These are the wings shall make it fly as swift
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,"As doth the lightning or the breath of heaven,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,And kill as sure  as it swiftly flies.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,Thy words assure me of kind success:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"Go, valiant soldier, go before, and charge"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,The fainting army of that foolish king.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Usumcasane and Techelles, come:"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"We are enow to scare the enemy,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,And more than needs to make an emperor.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,"Usumcasane and Techelles, come:"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,5,"We are enow to scare the enemy,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,6,And more than needs to make an emperor.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Accurs'd be he that first invented war!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"They knew not, ah, they knew not, simple men,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,How those were  hit by pelting cannon-shot
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,Stand staggering  like a quivering aspen-leaf
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,5,Fearing the force of Boreas' boisterous blasts!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,6,"In what a lamentable case were I,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,7,If nature had not given me wisdom's lore!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,8,"For kings are clouts that every man shoots at,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,9,Our crown the pin  that thousands seek to cleave:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,10,Therefore in policy I think it good
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,11,"To hide it close; a goodly stratagem,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,12,And far from any man that is a fool:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,13,"So shall not I be known; or if I be,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,14,They cannot take away my crown from me.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,15,Here will I hide it in this simple hole.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"What, fearful coward, straggling from the camp,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,When kings themselves are present in the field?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Thou liest.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Base villain, darest thou give me  the lie?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Away! I am the king; go; touch me not.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"Thou break'st the law of arms, unless thou kneel,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,"And cry me ""mercy, noble king!"""
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Are you the witty king of Persia?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Ay, marry,  am I:  have you any suit to me?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,I would entreat you to speak but three wise words.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,So I can when I see my time.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Is this your crown?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Ay:  didst thou ever see a fairer?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"You will not sell it, will you?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Such another word, and I will have thee executed.  Come,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,give it me.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,No; I took it prisoner.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,You lie; I gave it you.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Then 'tis mine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,No; I mean I let you keep it.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Well, I mean you shall have it again."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"Here, take it for a while:  I lend it thee,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,Till I may see thee hemm'd with armed men;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,Then shalt thou see me pull it from thy head:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,5,Thou art no match for mighty Tamburlaine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"O gods, is this Tamburlaine the thief?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,I marvel much he stole it not away.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,"O gods, is this Tamburlaine the thief?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MYCETES,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,4,I marvel much he stole it not away.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Hold thee, Cosroe; wear two imperial crowns;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,"Think thee invested now as royally,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,"Even by the mighty hand of Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,4,As if as many kings as could encompass thee
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,5,With greatest pomp had crown'd thee emperor.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"So do I, thrice-renowmed man-at-arms;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,And none shall keep the crown but Tamburlaine:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,"Thee do I make my regent of Persia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,4,And general-lieutenant of my armies.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,5,"Meander, you, that were our brother's guide,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,6,"And chiefest  counsellor in all his acts,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,7,"Since he is yielded to the stroke of war,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,8,"On your submission we with thanks excuse,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,9,And give you equal place in our affairs.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Most happy  emperor, in humblest terms"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,"I vow my service to your majesty,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,With utmost virtue of my faith and duty.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Thanks, good Meander.?”Then, Cosroe, reign,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,And govern Persia in her former pomp.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,"Now send embassage to thy neighbour kings,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,4,"And let them know the Persian king is chang'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,5,"From one that knew not what a king should do,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,6,To one that can command what 'longs thereto.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,7,And now we will to fair Persepolis
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,8,With twenty thousand expert soldiers.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,9,The lords and captains of my brother's camp
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,10,"With little slaughter take Meander's course,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,11,And gladly yield them to my gracious rule.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,12,"Ortygius and Menaphon, my trusty friends,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,13,"Now will I gratify your former good,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,14,And grace your calling with a greater sway.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"And as we ever aim'd  at your behoof,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,"And sought your state all honour it  deserv'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,So will we with our powers and our  lives
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,4,Endeavour to preserve and prosper it.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"I will not thank thee, sweet Ortygius;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,Better replies shall prove my purposes.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,"And now, Lord Tamburlaine, my brother's camp"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,4,"I leave to thee and to Theridamas,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,5,To follow me to fair Persepolis;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,6,Then will we  march to all those Indian mines
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,7,"My witless brother to the Christians lost,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,8,And ransom them with fame and usury:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,9,"And, till thou overtake me, Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,10,"(Staying to order all the scatter'd troops,)"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,11,"Farewell, lord regent and his happy friends."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,12,I long to sit upon my brother's throne.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Your majesty shall shortly have your wish,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,And ride in triumph through Persepolis.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,And ride in triumph through Persepolis!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,"Is it not brave to be a king, Techelles?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,"Usumcasane and Theridamas,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,4,"Is it not passing brave to be a king,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,5,And ride in triumph through Persepolis?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"O, my lord, it is sweet and full of pomp!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,To be a king is half to be a god.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,A god is not so glorious as a king:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,"I think the pleasure they enjoy in heaven,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,Cannot compare with kingly joys in  earth;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,4,"To wear a crown enchas'd with pearl and gold,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,5,Whose virtues carry with it life and death;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,6,"To ask and have, command and be obey'd;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,7,"When looks breed love, with looks to gain the prize,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,8,Such power attractive shines in princes' eyes.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Why, say, Theridamas, wilt thou be a king?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Nay, though I praise it, I can live without it."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,What say my other friends? will you be kings?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"I, if I could, with all my heart, my lord."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Why, that's well said, Techelles:  so would I;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,"And so would you, my masters, would you not?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"What, then, my lord?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Why, then, Casane,  shall we wish for aught"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,"The world affords in greatest novelty,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,"And rest attemptless, faint, and destitute?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,4,"Methinks we should not.  I am strongly mov'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,5,"That if I should desire the Persian crown,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,6,I could attain it with a wondrous ease:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,7,"And would not all our soldiers soon consent,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,8,If we should aim at such a dignity?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,I know they would with our persuasions.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Why, then, Theridamas, I'll first assay"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,To get the Persian kingdom to myself;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,Then thou for Parthia; they for Scythia and Media;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,4,"And, if I prosper, all shall be as sure"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,5,"As if the Turk, the Pope, Afric, and Greece,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,6,Came creeping to us with their crowns a-piece.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Then shall we send to this triumphing king,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,And bid him battle for his novel crown?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Nay, quickly, then, before his room be hot."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"'Twill prove a pretty jest, in faith, my friends."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,A jest to charge on twenty thousand men!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,I judge the purchase  more important far.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Judge by thyself, Theridamas, not me;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,2,For presently Techelles here shall haste
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,3,"To bid him battle ere he pass too far,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,4,And lose more labour than the gain will quite:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,5,Then shalt thou see this  Scythian Tamburlaine
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,6,Make but a jest to win the Persian crown.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,7,"Techelles, take a thousand horse with thee,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,8,"And bid him turn him  back to war with us,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,9,That only made him king to make us sport:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,10,"We will not steal upon him cowardly,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,11,But give him warning and  more warriors:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,12,"Haste thee, Techelles; we will follow thee."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,13,What saith Theridamas?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE V.,SCENE V.,1,"Go on, for me."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,2,"Go on, for me."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,1,"What means this devilish shepherd, to aspire"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,2,"With such a giantly presumption,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,3,"To cast up hills against the face of heaven,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,4,And dare the force of angry Jupiter?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,5,"But, as he thrust them underneath the hills,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,6,"And press'd out fire from their burning jaws,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,7,"So will I send this monstrous slave to hell,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,8,Where flames shall ever feed upon his soul.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,1,"Some powers divine, or else infernal, mix'd"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,2,Their angry seeds at his conception;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,3,"For he was never sprung  of human race,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,4,"Since with the spirit of his fearful pride,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,5,"He dares  so doubtlessly resolve of rule,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MEANDER,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,6,And by profession be ambitious.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,1,"What god, or fiend, or spirit of the earth,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,2,"Or monster turned to a manly shape,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,3,"Or of what mould or mettle he be made,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,4,"What star or fate  soever govern him,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,5,Let us put on our meet encountering minds;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,6,"And, in detesting such a devilish thief,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,7,"In love of honour and defence of right,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,8,"Be arm'd against the hate of such a foe,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ORTYGIUS,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,9,"Whether from earth, or hell, or heaven he grow."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,1,"Nobly resolv'd, my good Ortygius;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,2,"And, since we all have suck'd one wholesome air,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,3,And with the same proportion of elements
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,4,"Resolve,  I hope we are resembled,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,5,Vowing our loves to equal death and life.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,6,"Let's cheer our soldiers to encounter him,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,7,"That grievous image of ingratitude,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,8,"That fiery thirster after sovereignty,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,9,And burn him in the fury of that flame
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,10,That none can quench but blood and empery.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,11,"Resolve, my lords and loving soldiers, now"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,12,To save your king and country from decay.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,13,"Then strike up, drum; and all the stars that make"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,14,"The loathsome circle of my dated life,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,15,"Direct my weapon to his barbarous heart,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,16,"That thus opposeth him against the gods,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.,17,And scorns the powers that govern Persia!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,18,"Nobly resolv'd, my good Ortygius;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,19,"And, since we all have suck'd one wholesome air,"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,23,"Let's cheer our soldiers to encounter him,"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,27,That none can quench but blood and empery.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,28,"Resolve, my lords and loving soldiers, now"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,29,To save your king and country from decay.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,30,"Then strike up, drum; and all the stars that make"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,33,"That thus opposeth him against the gods,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,34,And scorns the powers that govern Persia!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,35,"Barbarous  and bloody Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,36,Thus to deprive me of my crown and life!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,37,"Treacherous and false Theridamas,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,38,"Even at the morning of my happy state,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,39,"Scarce being seated in my royal throne,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,40,To work my downfall and untimely end!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,41,An uncouth pain torments my grieved soul;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,42,"And death arrests the organ of my voice,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,43,"Who, entering at the breach thy sword hath made,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,44,Sacks every vein and artier  of my heart.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,45,Bloody and insatiate Tamburlaine!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,1,"The thirst of reign and sweetness of a crown,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,2,That caus'd the eldest son of heavenly Ops
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,3,"To thrust his doting father from his chair,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,4,"And place himself in the empyreal heaven,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,5,Mov'd me to manage arms against thy state.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,6,What better precedent than mighty Jove?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,7,"Nature, that fram'd us of four elements"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,8,"Warring within our breasts for regiment,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,9,Doth teach us all to have aspiring minds:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,10,"Our souls, whose faculties can comprehend"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,11,"The wondrous architecture of the world,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,12,"And measure every wandering planet's course,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,13,"Still climbing after knowledge infinite,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,14,"And always moving as the restless spheres,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,15,"Will us to wear ourselves, and never rest,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,16,"Until we reach the ripest fruit  of all,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,17,"That perfect bliss and sole felicity,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,18,The sweet fruition of an earthly crown.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,1,And that made me to join with Tamburlaine;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,2,For he is gross and like the massy earth
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,3,"That moves not upwards, nor by princely deeds"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,4,Doth mean to soar above the highest sort.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,1,"And that made us, the friends of Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,2,To lift our swords against the Persian king.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,1,"For as, when Jove did thrust old Saturn down,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,2,"Neptune and Dis gain'd each of them a crown,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,3,"So do we hope to reign in Asia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,4,If Tamburlaine be plac'd in Persia.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,1,The strangest men that ever nature made!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,2,I know not how to take their tyrannies.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,3,"My bloodless body waxeth chill and cold,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,4,And with my blood my life slides through my wound;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,5,"My soul begins to take her flight to hell,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,6,And summons all my senses to depart:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,7,"The heat and moisture, which did feed each other,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,8,"For want of nourishment to feed them both,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,9,Are  dry and cold; and now doth ghastly Death
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,10,"With greedy talents  gripe my bleeding heart,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,11,And like a harpy  tires on my life.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,12,"Theridamas and Tamburlaine, I die:"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,COSROE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,13,And fearful vengeance light upon you both!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,1,Not all the curses which the  Furies breathe
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,2,Shall make me leave so rich a prize as this.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,3,"Theridamas, Techelles, and the rest,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,4,Who think you now is king of Persia?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ALL,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,1,Tamburlaine!  Tamburlaine!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,1,"Though Mars himself, the angry god of arms,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,2,And all the earthly potentates conspire
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,3,"To dispossess me of this diadem,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,4,"Yet will I wear it in despite of them,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,5,"As great commander of this eastern world,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,6,If you but say that Tamburlaine shall reign.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ALL,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,1,"Long live Tamburlaine, and reign in Asia!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,1,So; now it is more surer on my head
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,2,"Than if the gods had held a parliament,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE VII.,SCENE VII.,3,And all pronounc'd me king of Persia.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,So; now it is more surer on my head
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"Than if the gods had held a parliament,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,And all pronounc'd me king of Persia.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Great kings of Barbary, and my portly bassoes,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"We hear the Tartars and the eastern thieves,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"Under the conduct of one Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Presume a bickering with your emperor,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,And think to rouse us from our dreadful siege
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,Of the famous Grecian Constantinople.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,You know our army is invincible;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"As many circumcised Turks we have,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,"And warlike bands of Christians renied,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,As hath the ocean or the Terrene  sea
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,11,Small drops of water when the moon begins
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,12,To join in one her semicircled horns:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,13,"Yet would we not be brav'd with foreign power,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,14,"Nor raise our siege before the Grecians yield,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,15,Or breathless lie before the city-walls.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF FEZ,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Renowmed  emperor and mighty general,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF FEZ,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"What, if you sent the bassoes of your guard"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF FEZ,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"To charge him to remain in Asia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF FEZ,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,Or else to threaten death and deadly arms
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF FEZ,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,As from the mouth of mighty Bajazeth?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Hie thee, my basso,  fast to Persia;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Tell him thy lord, the Turkish emperor,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"Dread lord of Afric, Europe, and Asia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Great king and conqueror of Graecia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"The ocean, Terrene, and the Coal-black sea,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"The high and highest monarch of the world,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,"Wills and commands, (for say not I entreat,)"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"Not  once to set his foot in  Africa,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,"Or spread  his colours in Graecia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,Lest he incur the fury of my wrath:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,11,"Tell him I am content to take a truce,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,12,Because I hear he bears a valiant mind:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,13,"But if, presuming on his silly power,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,14,"He be so mad to manage arms with me,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,15,"Then stay thou with him,?”say, I bid thee so;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,16,"And if, before the sun have measur'd heaven"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,17,"With triple circuit, thou regreet us not,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,18,We mean to take his morning's next arise
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,19,"For messenger he will not be reclaim'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,20,And mean to fetch thee in despite of him.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Most great and puissant monarch of the earth,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Your basso will accomplish your behest,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"And shew your pleasure to the Persian,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,As fits the legate of the stately Turk.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF ARGIER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,They say he is the king of Persia;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF ARGIER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"But, if he dare attempt to stir your siege,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF ARGIER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"'Twere requisite he should be ten times more,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF ARGIER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,For all flesh quakes at your magnificence.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"True, Argier; and tremble at my looks."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF MOROCCO,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,The spring is hinder'd by your smothering host;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF MOROCCO,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"For neither rain can fall upon the earth,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF MOROCCO,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"Nor sun reflex his virtuous beams thereon,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF MOROCCO,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,The ground is mantled with such multitudes.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,All this is true as holy Mahomet;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,And all the trees are blasted with our breaths.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF FEZ,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,What thinks your greatness best to be achiev'd
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF FEZ,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,In pursuit of the city's overthrow?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,I will the captive pioners  of Argier
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,Cut off the water that by leaden pipes
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,Runs to the city from the mountain Carnon;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Two thousand horse shall forage up and down,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,That no relief or succour come by land;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,And all the sea my galleys countermand:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,"Then shall our footmen lie within the trench,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"And with their cannons, mouth'd like Orcus' gulf,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,"Batter the walls, and we will enter in;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,And thus the Grecians shall be conquered.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,11,I will the captive pioners  of Argier

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Madam Zenocrate, may I presume"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,To know the cause of these unquiet fits
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,That work such trouble to your wonted rest?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,'Tis more than pity such a heavenly face
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"Should by heart's sorrow wax so wan and pale,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,When your offensive rape by Tamburlaine
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,(Which of your whole displeasures should be most)
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,Hath seem'd to be digested long ago.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Although it be digested long ago,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"As his exceeding favours have deserv'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"And might content the Queen of Heaven, as well"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,As it hath chang'd my first-conceiv'd disdain;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,Yet since a farther passion feeds my thoughts
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"With ceaseless  and disconsolate conceits,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"Which dye my looks so lifeless as they are,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,"And might, if my extremes had full events,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,Make me the ghastly counterfeit  of death.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Eternal heaven sooner be dissolv'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"And all that pierceth Phoebus' silver eye,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,Before such hap fall to Zenocrate!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Ah, life and soul, still hover in his  breast,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"And leave my body senseless as the earth,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"Or else unite you  to his life and soul,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,That I may live and die with Tamburlaine!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"With Tamburlaine!  Ah, fair Zenocrate,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Let not a man so vile and barbarous,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"That holds you from your father in despite,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"And keeps you from the honours of a queen,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"(Being suppos'd his worthless concubine,)"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,Be honour'd with your love but for necessity!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"So, now the mighty Soldan hears of you,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,Your highness needs not doubt but in short time
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,"He will, with Tamburlaine's destruction,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,Redeem you from this deadly servitude.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Leave  to wound me with these words,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,And speak of Tamburlaine as he deserves:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,The entertainment we have had of him
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"Is far from villany or servitude,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,And might in noble minds be counted princely.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"How can you fancy one that looks so fierce,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,Only dispos'd to martial stratagems?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"Who, when he shall embrace you in his arms,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,Will tell how many thousand men he slew;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"And, when you look for amorous discourse,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"Will rattle forth his facts  of war and blood,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,Too harsh a subject for your dainty ears.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"As looks the sun through Nilus' flowing stream,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Or when the Morning holds him in her arms,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"So looks my lordly love, fair Tamburlaine;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,His talk much  sweeter than the Muses' song
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"They sung for honour 'gainst Pierides,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,Or when Minerva did with Neptune strive:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,And higher would I rear my estimate
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,"Than Juno, sister to the highest god,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,If I were match'd with mighty Tamburlaine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Yet be not so inconstant in your love,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"But let the young Arabian  live in hope,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,After your rescue to enjoy his choice.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,"You see, though first the king of Persia,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"Being a shepherd, seem'd to love you much,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"Now, in his majesty, he leaves those looks,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,"Those words of favour, and those comfortings,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,And gives no more than common courtesies.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Thence rise the tears that so distain my cheeks,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,Fearing his love  through my unworthiness.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Betray'd by fortune and suspicious love,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"Threaten'd with frowning wrath and jealousy,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"Surpris'd with fear of  hideous revenge,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,I stand aghast; but most astonied
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,"To see his choler shut in secret thoughts,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,And wrapt in silence of his angry soul:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,Upon his brows was pourtray'd ugly death;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,"And in his eyes the fury  of his heart,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,"That shone  as comets, menacing revenge,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,And cast a pale complexion on his cheeks.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,11,As when the seaman sees the Hyades
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,12,"Gather an army of Cimmerian clouds,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,13,"(Auster and Aquilon with winged steeds,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,14,"All sweating, tilt about the watery heavens,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,15,"With shivering spears enforcing thunder-claps,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,16,"And from their shields strike flames of lightning,)"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,17,"All-fearful folds his sails, and sounds the main,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,18,Lifting his prayers to the heavens for aid
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,19,Against the terror of the winds and waves;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,20,"So fares Agydas for the late-felt frowns,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,21,"That send  a tempest to my daunted thoughts,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,22,And make my soul divine her overthrow.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"See you, Agydas, how the king salutes you!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,He bids you prophesy what it imports.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"I prophesied before, and now I prove"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,The killing frowns of jealousy and love.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"He needed not with words confirm my fear,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,For words are vain where working tools present
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,5,The naked action of my threaten'd end:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,6,"It says, Agydas, thou shalt surely die,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,7,And of extremities elect the least;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,8,"More honour and less pain it may procure,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,9,To die by this resolved hand of thine
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,10,Than stay the torments he and heaven have sworn.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,11,"Then haste, Agydas, and prevent the plagues"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,12,Which thy prolonged fates may draw on thee:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,13,"Go wander free from fear of tyrant's rage,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,14,Removed from the torments and the hell
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,15,Wherewith he may excruciate thy soul;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,16,"And let Agydas by Agydas die,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,AGYDAS,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,17,And with this stab slumber eternally.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Usumcasane, see, how right the man"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,Hath hit the meaning of my lord the king!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Faith, and, Techelles, it was manly done;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,2,"And, since he was so wise and honourable,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,3,"Let us afford him now the bearing hence,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,4,And crave his triple-worthy burial.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,1,"Agreed, Casane; we will honour him."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"Agreed, Casane; we will honour him."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Basso, by this thy lord and master knows"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,I mean to meet him in Bithynia:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"See, how he comes! tush, Turks are full of brags,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,And menace  more than they can well perform.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"He meet me in the field, and fetch  thee hence!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,"Alas, poor Turk! his fortune is too weak"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,7,T' encounter with the strength of Tamburlaine:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,8,"View well my camp, and speak indifferently;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,9,Do not my captains and my soldiers look
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,10,As if they meant to conquer Africa?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Your men are valiant, but their number few,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,And cannot terrify his mighty host:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"My lord, the great commander of the world,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,"Besides fifteen contributory kings,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"Hath now in arms ten thousand janizaries,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,"Mounted on lusty Mauritanian steeds,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,7,Brought to the war by men of Tripoly;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,8,Two hundred thousand footmen that have serv'd
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,9,In two set battles fought in Graecia;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,10,"And for the expedition of this war,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,11,"If he think good, can from his garrisons"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,12,Withdraw as many more to follow him.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"The more he brings, the greater is the spoil;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"For, when they perish by our warlike hands,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"We mean to set  our footmen on their steeds,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,And rifle all those stately janizars.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,But will those kings accompany your lord?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,Such as his highness please; but some must stay
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BASSO,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,To rule the provinces he late subdu'd.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,Then fight courageously:  their crowns are yours;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"This hand shall set them on your conquering heads,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,That made me emperor of Asia.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Let him bring millions infinite of men,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"Unpeopling Western Africa and Greece,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,Yet we assure us of the victory.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Even he, that in a trice vanquish'd two kings"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"More mighty than the Turkish emperor,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"Shall rouse him out of Europe, and pursue"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,His scatter'd army till they yield or die.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Well said, Theridamas! speak in that mood;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"For WILL and SHALL best fitteth Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,Whose smiling stars give him assured hope
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,Of martial triumph ere he meet his foes.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"I that am term'd the scourge and wrath of God,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,"The only fear and terror of the world,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,7,"Will first subdue the Turk, and then enlarge"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,8,"Those Christian captives which you keep as slaves,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,9,"Burdening their bodies with your heavy chains,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,10,And feeding them with thin and slender fare;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,11,"That naked row about the Terrene  sea,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,12,"And, when they chance to rest or breathe  a space,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,13,Are punish'd with bastones  so grievously
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,14,"That they  lie panting on the galleys' side,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,15,And strive for life at every stroke they give.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,16,"These are the cruel pirates of Argier,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,17,"That damned train, the scum of Africa,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,18,"Inhabited with straggling runagates,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,19,That make quick havoc of the Christian blood:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,20,"But, as I live, that town shall curse the time"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,21,That Tamburlaine set foot in Africa.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Bassoes and janizaries of my guard,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"Attend upon the person of your lord,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,The greatest potentate of Africa.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Techelles and the rest, prepare your swords;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,I mean t' encounter with that Bajazeth.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Kings of Fez, Morocco,  and Argier,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"He calls me Bajazeth, whom you call lord!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,Note the presumption of this Scythian slave!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,"I tell thee, villain, those that lead my horse"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,Have to their names titles  of dignity;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,And dar'st thou bluntly call me Bajazeth?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"And know, thou Turk, that those which lead my horse"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,Shall lead thee captive thorough Africa;

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,And in my sarell  tend my concubines;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"And all his captains, that thus stoutly stand,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,"Shall draw the chariot of my emperess,"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,Thou wilt repent these lavish words of thine
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,When thy great basso-master and thyself
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"Must plead for mercy at his kingly feet,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,And sue to me to be your advocate.

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,EBEA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"But I shall turn her into other weeds,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,EBEA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,And make her dainty fingers fall to work.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Hear'st thou, Anippe, how thy drudge doth talk?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"And how my slave, her mistress, menaceth?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,Both for their sauciness shall be employ'd
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,To dress the common soldiers' meat and drink;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,For we will scorn they should come near ourselves.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ANIPPE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,Yet sometimes let your highness send for them
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ANIPPE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,To do the work my chambermaid disdains.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Ye gods and powers that govern Persia,"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"Now strengthen him against the Turkish Bajazeth,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,"And let his foes, like flocks of fearful roes"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"Pursu'd by hunters, fly his angry looks,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,That I may see him issue conqueror!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Now, Mahomet, solicit God himself,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"And make him rain down murdering shot from heaven,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"To dash the Scythians' brains, and strike them dead,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,That dare  to manage arms with him
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,That offer'd jewels to thy sacred shrine
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,When first he warr'd against the Christians!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"By this the Turks lie weltering in their blood,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,And Tamburlaine is lord of Africa.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,Thou art deceiv'd.  I heard the trumpets sound
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"As when my emperor overthrew the Greeks,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,And led them captive into Africa.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,Straight will I use thee as thy pride deserves;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,Prepare thyself to live and die my slave.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,If Mahomet should come from heaven and swear
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"My royal lord is slain or conquered,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,Yet should he not persuade me otherwise
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,But that he lives and will be conqueror.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Now, king of bassoes, who is conqueror?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Thou, by the fortune of this damned foil."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,Where are your stout contributory kings?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,We have their crowns; their bodies strow the field.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Each man a crown! why, kingly fought, i'faith."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,Deliver them into my treasury.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,Now let me offer to my gracious lord
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,His royal crown again so highly won.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Nay, take the Turkish crown from her, Zenocrate,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,And crown me emperor of Africa.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"No, Tamburlaine; though now thou gat  the best,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,Thou shalt not yet be lord of Africa.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Give her the crown, Turkess, you were best."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Injurious villains, thieves, runagates,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,How dare you thus abuse my majesty?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Here, madam, you are empress; she is none."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Not now, Theridamas; her time is past:"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"The pillars, that have bolster'd up those terms,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,Are faln in clusters at my conquering feet.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Though he be prisoner, he may be ransom'd."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,Not all the world shall ransom Bajazeth.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Ah, fair Zabina! we have lost the field;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,And never had the Turkish emperor
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,So great a foil by any foreign foe.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,"Now will the Christian miscreants be glad,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"Ringing with joy their superstitious bells,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,And making bonfires for my overthrow:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,7,"But, ere I die, those foul idolaters"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,8,Shall make me bonfires with their filthy bones;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,9,"For, though the glory of this day be lost,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,10,Afric and Greece have garrisons enough
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,11,To make me sovereign of the earth again.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Those walled garrisons will I subdue,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,And write myself great lord of Africa:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,So from the East unto the furthest West
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,Shall Tamburlaine extend his puissant arm.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"The galleys and those pilling  brigandines,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,"That yearly sail to the Venetian gulf,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,7,"And hover in the Straits for Christians' wreck,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,8,"Shall lie at anchor in the Isle Asant,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,9,"Until the Persian fleet and men-of-war,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,10,"Sailing along the oriental sea,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,11,"Have fetch'd about the Indian continent,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,12,"Even from Persepolis to Mexico,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,13,And thence unto the Straits of Jubalter;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,14,Where they shall meet and join their force in one.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,15,"Keeping in awe the Bay of Portingale,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,16,And all the ocean by the British  shore;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,17,And by this means I'll win the world at last.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Yet set a ransom on me, Tamburlaine."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"What, think'st thou Tamburlaine esteems thy gold?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"I'll make the kings of India, ere I die,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,3,"Offer their mines, to sue for peace, to me,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,And dig for treasure to appease my wrath.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"Come, bind them both, and one lead in the Turk;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,"The Turkess let my love's maid lead away,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Ah, villains, dare you touch my sacred arms?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,O Mahomet!  O sleepy Mahomet!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"O cursed Mahomet, that mak'st us thus"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,The slaves to Scythians rude and barbarous!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,1,"Come, bring them in; and for this happy conquest"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,2,"Triumph, and solemnize a martial  feast."

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"The rogue of Volga holds Zenocrate,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"The Soldan's daughter, for his concubine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"And, with a troop of thieves and vagabonds,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,"Hath spread his colours to our high disgrace,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"While you, faint-hearted base Egyptians,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,"Lie slumbering on the flowery banks of Nile,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,As crocodiles that unaffrighted rest
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,11,While thundering cannons rattle on their skins.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Nay, mighty Soldan, did your greatness see"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"The frowning looks of fiery Tamburlaine,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,That with his terror and imperious eyes
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Commands the hearts of his associates,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,It might amaze your royal majesty.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Villain, I tell thee, were that Tamburlaine"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"As monstrous  as Gorgon prince of hell,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,The Soldan would not start a foot from him.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"But speak, what power hath he?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Mighty lord,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Three hundred thousand men in armour clad,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"Upon their prancing steeds, disdainfully"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,With wanton paces trampling on the ground;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"Five hundred thousand footmen threatening shot,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"Shaking their swords, their spears, and iron bills,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,"Environing their standard round, that stood"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,As bristle-pointed as a thorny wood;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,9,Their warlike engines and munition
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,MESSENGER,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,10,Exceed the forces of their martial men.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Nay, could their numbers countervail the stars,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Or ever-drizzling  drops of April showers,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"Or wither'd leaves that autumn shaketh down,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,Yet would the Soldan by his conquering power
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"So scatter and consume them in his rage,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,That not a man should  live to rue their fall.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CAPOLIN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"So might your highness, had you time to sort"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CAPOLIN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Your fighting men, and raise your royal host;"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CAPOLIN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,But Tamburlaine by expedition
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,CAPOLIN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,Advantage takes of your unreadiness.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,Let him take all th' advantages he can:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,"Were all the world conspir'd to fight for him,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,3,"Nay, were he devil,  as he is no man,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Yet in revenge of fair Zenocrate,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"Whom he detaineth in despite of us,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,"This arm should send him down to Erebus,"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,18,"Now may we see Damascus' lofty towers,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,19,Like to the shadows of Pyramides
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,20,That with their beauties grace  the Memphian fields.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,21,"The golden stature  of their feather'd bird,"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,23,Shall not defend it from our battering shot:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,24,"The townsmen mask in silk and cloth of gold,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE II.,SCENE II.,25,And every house is as a treasury;

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,13,"By murder raised to the Persian crown,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,14,That dare control us in our territories.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,15,"To tame the pride of this presumptuous beast,"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,17,"Let us unite our royal bands in one,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,18,And hasten to remove Damascus' siege.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,19,It is a blemish to the majesty
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,20,"And high estate of mighty emperors,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,21,That such a base usurping vagabond

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,4,"No more dismay'd with tidings of his fall,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,"Than in the haven when the pilot stands,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,"And views a stranger's ship rent in the winds,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,SOLDAN,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,7,And shivered against a craggy rock:

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF ARABIA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,5,And prove the weight of his victorious arm;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF ARABIA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,6,"For fame, I fear, hath been too prodigal"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,KING OF ARABIA,SCENE III.,SCENE III.,7,In sounding through the world his partial praise.

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,5,"Then let us freely banquet, and carouse"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,6,"Full bowls of wine unto the god of war,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,7,"That means to fill your helmets full of gold,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,8,And make Damascus' spoils as rich to you
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,9,As was to Jason Colchos' golden fleece.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,10,"And now, Bajazeth, hast thou any stomach?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Ay, such a stomach, cruel Tamburlaine, as I could"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,willingly feed upon thy blood-raw heart.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Nay, thine own is easier to come by:  pluck out"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"that; and 'twill serve thee and thy wife.?”Well, Zenocrate,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,"Techelles, and the rest, fall to your victuals."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Fall to, and never may your meat digest!"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"Ye Furies, that can mask  invisible,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,"Dive to the bottom of Avernus' pool,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,"And in your hands bring hellish poison up,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,5,And squeeze it in the cup of Tamburlaine!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,6,"Or, winged snakes of Lerna, cast your stings,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,7,And leave your venoms in this tyrant's dish?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,And may this banquet prove as ominous
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,As Progne's to th' adulterous Thracian king
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,That fed upon the substance of his child!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"My lord,  how can you suffer these"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,Outrageous curses by these slaves of yours?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"To let them see, divine Zenocrate,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"I glory in the curses of my foes,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,Having the power from the empyreal heaven
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,To turn them all upon their proper heads.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"I pray you, give them leave, madam; this speech"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,is a goodly refreshing for them.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"But, if his highness would let them be fed,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,it would do them more good.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Sirrah, why fall you not to? are you so daintily"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"brought up, you cannot eat your own flesh?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"First, legions of devils shall tear thee in pieces."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Villain, knowest thou to whom thou speakest?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"O, let him alone.?”Here;  eat, sir; take it"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"from  my sword's point, or I'll thrust it to thy heart."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"He stamps it under his feet, my lord."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Take it up, villain, and eat it; or I will make thee"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,slice  the brawns of thy arms into carbonadoes and eat them.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Nay, 'twere better he killed his wife, and then she"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"shall be sure not to be starved, and he be provided for a month's"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,USUMCASANE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,victual beforehand.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Here is my dagger:  despatch her while she is fat;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"for, if she live but a while longer, she will fall  into a"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,"consumption with fretting, and then she will not be worth the"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,eating.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Dost thou think that Mahomet will suffer this?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"'Tis like he will, when he cannot let  it."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Go to; fall to your meat.  What, not a bit!?”Belike"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,he hath not been watered to-day:  give him some drink.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,"Fast, and welcome, sir, while  hunger make you eat.?”How now,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,Zenocrate! doth not the Turk and his wife make a goodly show at a
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,5,banquet?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Yes, my lord."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Methinks 'tis a great deal better than a consort  of music.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Yet music would do well to cheer up Zenocrate.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"Pray thee, tell why art thou so sad? if thou wilt have a song,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,the Turk shall strain his voice:  but why is it?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"My lord, to see my father's town besieg'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"The country wasted where myself was born,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,How can it but afflict my very soul?
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,"If any love remain in you, my lord,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,5,Or if my love unto your majesty
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,6,"May merit favour at your highness' hands,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,7,"Then raise your siege from fair Damascus' walls,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,8,And with my father take a friendly truce.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Zenocrate, were Egypt Jove's own land,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,Yet would I with my sword make Jove to stoop.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,I will confute those blind geographers
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,"That make a triple region in the world,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,5,"Excluding regions which I mean to trace,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,6,"And with this pen  reduce them to a map,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,7,"Calling the provinces, cities, and towns,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,8,"After my name and thine, Zenocrate:"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,9,Here at Damascus will I make the point
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,10,That shall begin the perpendicular:
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,11,And wouldst thou have me buy thy father's love
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,12,"With such a loss? tell me, Zenocrate."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,Honour still wait on happy Tamburlaine!
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZENOCRATE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"Yet give me leave to plead for him, my lord."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Content thyself:  his person shall be safe,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"And all the friends of fair Zenocrate,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,"If with their lives they will be pleas'd to yield,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,Or may be forc'd to make me emperor;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,5,For Egypt and Arabia must be mine.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,6,"Feed, you slave; thou mayst think thyself happy to be fed from"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,7,my trencher.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"My empty stomach, full of idle heat,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"Draws bloody humours from my feeble parts,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,Preserving life by hastening  cruel death.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,My veins are pale; my sinews hard and dry;
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,5,"My joints benumb'd; unless I eat, I die."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Eat, Bajazeth; let us live in spite of them, looking"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,ZABINA,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,some happy power will pity and enlarge us.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Here, Turk; wilt thou have a clean trencher?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Ay, tyrant, and more meat."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Soft, sir! you must be dieted; too much eating"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,will make you surfeit.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"So it would, my lord, 'specially  having so small"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,a walk and so little exercise.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Theridamas, Techelles, and Casane, here are the"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"cates you desire to finger, are they not?"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Ay, my lord:  but none save kings must feed with"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,these.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"'Tis enough for us to see them, and for Tamburlaine"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TECHELLES,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,only to enjoy them.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Well; here is now to the Soldan of Egypt, the King"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,"of Arabia, and the Governor of Damascus.   Now, take these three"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,"crowns, and pledge me, my contributory kings.  I crown you here,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,4,"Theridamas, king of Argier; Techelles, king of Fez; and"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,5,"Usumcasane, king of Morocco. ?”How say you to this, Turk? these are"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,6,not your contributory kings.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,BAJAZETH,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Nor shall they long be thine, I warrant them."
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"Kings of Argier, Morocco, and of Fez,"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,10,And they are worthy she investeth kings.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,1,"And, since your highness hath so well vouchsaf'd,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,2,If we deserve them not with higher meeds
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,THERIDAMAS,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,3,"Than erst our states and actions have retain'd,"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,6,"Zenocrate, I will not crown thee yet,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.,7,Until with greater honours I be grac'd.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,TAMBURLAINE,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,8,"Well said, Theridamas:  when holy Fates"

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,GOVERNOR,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,1,"Still doth this man, or rather god of war,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,GOVERNOR,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,2,Batter our walls and beat our turrets down;

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,GOVERNOR,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,4,"Or hope of rescue from the Soldan's power,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,GOVERNOR,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,5,"Were but to bring our wilful overthrow,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,GOVERNOR,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,6,And make us desperate of our threaten'd lives.
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,GOVERNOR,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,7,We see his tents have now been altered

Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,GOVERNOR,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,12,"Offer our safeties to his clemency,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,GOVERNOR,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,13,"I fear the custom proper to his sword,"
Tamburlaine the Great-Part1,GOVERNOR,SCENE I.,SCENE I.,14,"Which he observes as parcel of his fame,"
