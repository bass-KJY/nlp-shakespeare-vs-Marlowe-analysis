<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Now is the winter of our discontent<br>
Made glorious summer by this son of York;<br>
And all the clouds that loured upon our house<br>
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.<br>
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,<br>
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,<br>
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,<br>
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.<br>
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;<br>
And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds<br>
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,<br>
He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber<br>
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.<br>
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,<br>
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;<br>
I, that am rudely stamped, and want love’s majesty<br>
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;<br>
I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,<br>
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,<br>
Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time<br>
Into this breathing world scarce half made up,<br>
And that so lamely and unfashionable<br>
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them—<br>
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,<br>
Have no delight to pass away the time,<br>
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun,<br>
And descant on mine own deformity.<br>
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover<br>
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,<br>
I am determined to prove a villain,<br>
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.<br>
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,<br>
By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,<br>
To set my brother Clarence and the King<br>
In deadly hate the one against the other;<br>
And if King Edward be as true and just<br>
As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,<br>
This day should Clarence closely be mewed up<br>
About a prophecy which says that “G”<br>
Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.<br>
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Clarence</span>, guarded
and <span class="charname">Brakenbury</span>.</p>
<p class="drama">
Brother, good day. What means this armed guard<br>
That waits upon your Grace?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLARENCE.<br>
His Majesty,<br>
Tend’ring my person’s safety, hath appointed<br>
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Upon what cause?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLARENCE.<br>
Because my name is George.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.<br>
He should, for that, commit your godfathers.<br>
O, belike his Majesty hath some intent<br>
That you should be new-christened in the Tower.<br>
But what’s the matter, Clarence? May I know?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLARENCE.<br>
Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest<br>
As yet I do not. But, as I can learn,<br>
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,<br>
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,<br>
And says a wizard told him that by “G”<br>
His issue disinherited should be.<br>
And for my name of George begins with G,<br>
It follows in his thought that I am he.<br>
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these,<br>
Hath moved his Highness to commit me now.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.<br>
’Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;<br>
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she<br>
That tempers him to this extremity.<br>
Was it not she and that good man of worship,<br>
Antony Woodville, her brother there,<br>
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,<br>
From whence this present day he is delivered?<br>
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLARENCE.<br>
By heaven, I think there is no man secure<br>
But the Queen’s kindred, and night-walking heralds<br>
That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.<br>
Heard you not what an humble suppliant<br>
Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Humbly complaining to her deity<br>
Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.<br>
I’ll tell you what: I think it is our way,<br>
If we will keep in favour with the King,<br>
To be her men and wear her livery.<br>
The jealous o’er-worn widow and herself,<br>
Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen,<br>
Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.
</p>
<p class="drama">
BRAKENBURY.<br>
I beseech your Graces both to pardon me.<br>
His Majesty hath straitly given in charge<br>
That no man shall have private conference,<br>
Of what degree soever, with your brother.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Even so; an please your worship, Brakenbury,<br>
You may partake of anything we say.<br>
We speak no treason, man. We say the King<br>
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble Queen<br>
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.<br>
We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,<br>
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;<br>
And that the Queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks.<br>
How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
</p>
<p class="drama">
BRAKENBURY.<br>
With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Naught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee, fellow,<br>
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,<br>
Were best to do it secretly alone.
</p>
<p class="drama">
BRAKENBURY.<br>
What one, my lord?
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?
</p>
<p class="drama">
BRAKENBURY.<br>
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal<br>
Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLARENCE.<br>
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
We are the Queen’s abjects and must obey.<br>
Brother, farewell. I will unto the King,<br>
And whatsoe’er you will employ me in,<br>
Were it to call King Edward’s widow “sister,”<br>
I will perform it to enfranchise you.<br>
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood<br>
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLARENCE.<br>
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.<br>
I will deliver or else lie for you.<br>
Meantime, have patience.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLARENCE.<br>
I must perforce. Farewell.
</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Clarence, Brakenbury</span> and guard.</i>]</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne’er return.<br>
Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so<br>
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,<br>
If heaven will take the present at our hands.<br>
But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?
</p>
<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Lord Hastings</span>.</p>
<p class="drama">
HASTINGS.<br>
Good time of day unto my gracious lord.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.<br>
Well are you welcome to the open air.<br>
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?
</p>
<p class="drama">
HASTINGS.<br>
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;<br>
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks<br>
That were the cause of my imprisonment.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too,<br>
For they that were your enemies are his,<br>
And have prevailed as much on him as you.
</p>
<p class="drama">
HASTINGS.<br>
More pity that the eagles should be mewed,<br>
Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
What news abroad?
</p>
<p class="drama">
HASTINGS.<br>
No news so bad abroad as this at home:<br>
The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,<br>
And his physicians fear him mightily.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.<br>
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,<br>
And overmuch consumed his royal person.<br>
’Tis very grievous to be thought upon.<br>
Where is he, in his bed?
</p>
<p class="drama">
HASTINGS.<br>
He is.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Go you before, and I will follow you.
</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit <span class="charname">Hastings</span>.</i>]</p>
<p class="drama">
He cannot live, I hope, and must not die<br>
Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven.<br>
I’ll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence<br>
With lies well steeled with weighty arguments;<br>
And, if I fail not in my deep intent,<br>
Clarence hath not another day to live;<br>
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,<br>
And leave the world for me to bustle in.<br>
For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter.<br>
What though I killed her husband and her father?<br>
The readiest way to make the wench amends<br>
Is to become her husband and her father;<br>
The which will I, not all so much for love<br>
As for another secret close intent,<br>
By marrying her which I must reach unto.<br>
But yet I run before my horse to market.<br>
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns.<br>
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

Th’ untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.<br>
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king,<br>
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster.<br>
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood,<br>
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost<br>

Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life<br>
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.<br>

Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it;<br>
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence.<br>

Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,<br>

If ever he have child, abortive be it,<br>
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,<br>
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect<br>
May fright the hopeful mother at the view,<br>
And that be heir to his unhappiness.<br>
If ever he have wife, let her be made<br>
More miserable by the death of him<br>
Than I am made by my young lord and thee.<br>
Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load,<br>
Taken from Paul’s to be interred there;<br>
And still, as you are weary of this weight,<br>
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry’s corse.

Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,<br>

Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead,<br>

To leave this keen encounter of our wits,<br>

As blameful as the executioner?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANNE.<br>
Thou wast the cause and most accursed effect.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
Your beauty was the cause of that effect:<br>
Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep<br>
To undertake the death of all the world,<br>
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANNE.<br>

It is a quarrel just and reasonable,<br>
To be revenged on him that killed my husband.
</p>
<p class="drama">

Did it to help thee to a better husband.

RICHARD.<br>
I would they were, that I might die at once;<br>
For now they kill me with a living death.<br>
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,<br>
Shamed their aspects with store of childish drops.<br>
These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,<br>
No, when my father York and Edward wept<br>
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made<br>
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;<br>
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,<br>
Told the sad story of my father’s death,<br>
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,<br>
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks<br>
Like trees bedashed with rain. In that sad time<br>
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;<br>
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,<br>
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.<br>
I never sued to friend nor enemy;<br>
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;<br>
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,<br>
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
</p>
<p class="right">[<i>She looks scornfully at him.</i>]</p>

And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,<br>
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,<br>

O, I have passed a miserable night,<br>
So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,<br>
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,<br>
I would not spend another such a night<br>
Though ’twere to buy a world of happy days,<br>
So full of dismal terror was the time!
</p>
<p class="drama">
KEEPER.<br>
What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLARENCE.<br>
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,<br>
And was embarked to cross to Burgundy;<br>
And in my company my brother Gloucester,<br>
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk<br>
Upon the hatches. Thence we looked toward England,<br>
And cited up a thousand heavy times,<br>
During the wars of York and Lancaster,<br>
That had befall’n us. As we paced along<br>
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,<br>
Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling,<br>
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard<br>
Into the tumbling billows of the main.<br>
O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,<br>
What dreadful noise of waters in my ears;<br>
What sights of ugly death within my eyes.<br>
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks;<br>
A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon;<br>
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,<br>
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,<br>
All scattered in the bottom of the sea.<br>
Some lay in dead men’s skulls, and in the holes<br>
Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept—<br>
As ’twere in scorn of eyes—reflecting gems,<br>
That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep,<br>
And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.

Methought I had; and often did I strive<br>
To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood<br>
Stopped in my soul, and would not let it forth<br>

But smothered it within my panting bulk,<br>
Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.

Awaked you not in this sore agony?

<p class="drama">
CLARENCE.<br>
No, no, my dream was lengthened after life.<br>
O, then began the tempest to my soul.<br>
I passed, methought, the melancholy flood,<br>
With that sour ferryman which poets write of,<br>
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.<br>
The first that there did greet my stranger-soul<br>
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,<br>
Who spake aloud, “What scourge for perjury<br>
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?”<br>
And so he vanished. Then came wand’ring by<br>
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair<br>
Dabbled in blood; and he shrieked out aloud<br>
“Clarence is come—false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,<br>
That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury!<br>
Seize on him, Furies! Take him unto torment!”<br>
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends<br>
Environed me, and howled in mine ears<br>
Such hideous cries that with the very noise<br>
I trembling waked, and for a season after<br>
Could not believe but that I was in hell,<br>
Such terrible impression made my dream.

Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,<br>
Kneeled at my feet, and bid me be advised?<br>

Who told me how the poor soul did forsake<br>
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?<br>

When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,<br>
And said, “Dear brother, live, and be a king”?<br>
Who told me, when we both lay in the field<br>
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me<br>
Even in his garments, and did give himself,<br>
All thin and naked, to the numb-cold night?<br>
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath<br>

Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced<br>

To those whose dealings have deserved the place<br>
And those who have the wit to claim the place.<br>
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it<br>
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.<br>

Then certifies your lordship that this night<br>
He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.<br>

Which may make you and him to rue at th’ other.<br>
Therefore he sends to know your lordship’s pleasure,<br>
If you will presently take horse with him<br>
And with all speed post with him toward the north,<br>
To shun the danger that his soul divines.

HASTINGS.<br>
Go, fellow, go. Return unto thy lord;<br>
Bid him not fear the separated council.<br>
His honour and myself are at the one,<br>
And at the other is my good friend Catesby,<br>
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us<br>
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.<br>
Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance.<br>
And for his dreams, I wonder he’s so simple<br>
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers.<br>
To fly the boar before the boar pursues<br>
Were to incense the boar to follow us,<br>
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.<br>
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me,<br>
And we will both together to the Tower,<br>
Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly.

Ay, my good lord.
</p>

CATESBY.<br>
Ay, on my life, and hopes to find you forward<br>
Upon his party for the gain thereof;<br>
And thereupon he sends you this good news,<br>
That this same very day your enemies,<br>

</p>

HASTINGS.<br>
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,<br>

God knows I will not do it, to the death.

I’ll send some packing that yet think not on’t.

BUCKINGHAM.<br>
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,<br>

Th’ insatiate greediness of his desire,<br>
And his enforcement of the city wives;<br>
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,<br>
As being got, your father then in France,<br>
And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.<br>
Withal, I did infer your lineaments,<br>
Being the right idea of your father,<br>
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;<br>
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,<br>
Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,<br>
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;<br>
Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose<br>
Untouched or slightly handled in discourse.<br>
And when mine oratory drew toward end,<br>
I bid them that did love their country’s good<br>
Cry “God save Richard, England’s royal King!”

And did they so?
</p>
<p class="drama">
BUCKINGHAM.<br>
No, so God help me, they spake not a word,<br>
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,<br>
Stared each on other, and looked deadly pale.<br>
Which when I saw, I reprehended them,<br>
And asked the Mayor what meant this wilful silence.<br>
His answer was, the people were not used<br>
To be spoke to but by the Recorder.<br>
Then he was urged to tell my tale again:<br>
“Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferred”<br>
But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.<br>
When he had done, some followers of mine own,<br>
At lower end of the hall, hurled up their caps,<br>
And some ten voices cried, “God save King Richard!”<br>
And thus I took the vantage of those few.<br>
“Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,” quoth I;<br>
“This general applause and cheerful shout<br>
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.”<br>

Will not the Mayor then and his brethren, come?

The supreme seat, the throne majestical,<br>
The sceptered office of your ancestors,<br>
Your state of fortune, and your due of birth,<br>
The lineal glory of your royal house,<br>
To the corruption of a blemished stock;<br>
Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,<br>
Which here we waken to our country’s good,<br>
The noble isle doth want her proper limbs;<br>
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,<br>
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,<br>
And almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf<br>
Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion;<br>
Which to recure, we heartily solicit<br>
Your gracious self to take on you the charge<br>
And kingly government of this your land,<br>
Not as Protector, steward, substitute,<br>
Or lowly factor for another’s gain,<br>
But as successively, from blood to blood,<br>
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.<br>
For this, consorted with the citizens,<br>
Your very worshipful and loving friends,<br>
And by their vehement instigation,<br>
In this just cause come I to move your Grace.
</p>
<p class="drama">
RICHARD.<br>
I cannot tell if to depart in silence<br>
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof<br>
Best fitteth my degree or your condition.<br>
If not to answer, you might haply think<br>
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded<br>
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,<br>
Which fondly you would here impose on me;<br>
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,<br>
So seasoned with your faithful love to me,<br>
Then, on the other side, I checked my friends.<br>
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,<br>
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,<br>
Definitively thus I answer you:<br>
Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert<br>
Unmeritable shuns your high request.<br>
First, if all obstacles were cut away,<br>
And that my path were even to the crown<br>
As the ripe revenue and due of birth,<br>
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,<br>
So mighty and so many my defects,<br>
That I would rather hide me from my greatness,<br>
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,<br>
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,<br>
And in the vapour of my glory smothered.<br>
But, God be thanked, there is no need of me,<br>
And much I need to help you, were there need.<br>
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,<br>
Which, mellowed by the stealing hours of time,<br>
Will well become the seat of majesty,<br>
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.<br>
On him I lay that you would lay on me,<br>
The right and fortune of his happy stars,<br>
Which God defend that I should wring from him.
</p>
<p class="drama">
BUCKINGHAM.<br>
My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace;<br>
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,<br>
All circumstances well considered.<br>
You say that Edward is your brother’s son;<br>
So say we too, but not by Edward’s wife.<br>
For first was he contract to Lady Lucy<br>
Your mother lives a witness to his vow,<br>
And afterward by substitute betrothed<br>
To Bona, sister to the King of France.<br>
These both put off, a poor petitioner,<br>
A care-crazed mother to a many sons,<br>
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,<br>
Even in the afternoon of her best days,<br>
Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,<br>
Seduced the pitch and height of his degree<br>
To base declension and loathed bigamy.<br>
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got<br>
This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.<br>
More bitterly could I expostulate,<br>
Save that, for reverence to some alive,<br>
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.<br>
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self<br>
This proffered benefit of dignity,<br>
If not to bless us and the land withal,<br>
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry<br>
From the corruption of abusing times<br>
Unto a lineal true-derived course.

Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction.<br>
No doubt the murd’rous knife was dull and blunt<br>
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,<br>

But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,<br>
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys<br>
Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes,<br>
And I, in such a desp’rate bay of death,<br>
Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft,<br>
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

</p>
<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br>
Madam, with all my heart.
</p>
<p class="drama">
QUEEN ELIZABETH.<br>
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,<br>
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave<br>
“Edward” and “York.” Then haply will she weep.<br>
Therefore present to her—as sometimes Margaret<br>
Did to thy father, steeped in Rutland’s blood—<br>
A handkerchief, which, say to her, did drain<br>
The purple sap from her sweet brothers’ body,<br>
And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.<br>
If this inducement move her not to love,<br>
Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;<br>
Tell her thou mad’st away her uncle Clarence,<br>
Her uncle Rivers, ay, and for her sake<br>
Mad’st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
</p>

And not be Richard, that hath done all this.
</p>
<p class="drama">

Say that I did all this for love of her?
</p>
<p class="drama">
QUEEN ELIZABETH.<br>
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,<br>
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
</p>
<p class="drama">
KING RICHARD.<br>
Look what is done cannot be now amended.<br>
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,<br>
Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.<br>
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,<br>
To make amends I’ll give it to your daughter.<br>
If I have killed the issue of your womb,<br>
To quicken your increase I will beget<br>
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.<br>
A grandam’s name is little less in love<br>
Than is the doting title of a mother;<br>
They are as children but one step below,<br>
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;<br>
Of all one pain, save for a night of groans<br>
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.<br>
Your children were vexation to your youth,<br>
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.<br>
The loss you have is but a son being King,<br>
And by that loss your daughter is made Queen.<br>
I cannot make you what amends I would;<br>
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.<br>
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul<br>
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,<br>
This fair alliance quickly shall call home<br>
To high promotions and great dignity.<br>
The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,<br>
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;<br>
Again shall you be mother to a king,<br>
And all the ruins of distressful times<br>
Repaired with double riches of content.<br>
What, we have many goodly days to see.<br>
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed<br>
Shall come again, transformed to orient pearl,<br>
Advantaging their loan with interest<br>
Of ten times double gain of happiness.<br>
Go then, my mother, to thy daughter go.<br>
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;<br>
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer’s tale;<br>
Put in her tender heart th’ aspiring flame<br>
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princess<br>
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys,<br>
And when this arm of mine hath chastised<br>
The petty rebel, dull-brained Buckingham,<br>
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come<br>
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror’s bed;<br>
To whom I will retail my conquest won,<br>
And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar’s Caesar.
</p>
<p class="drama">
QUEEN ELIZABETH.<br>
What were I best to say? Her father’s brother<br>
Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?<br>

That God, the law, my honour, and her love<br>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
